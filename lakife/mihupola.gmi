## Metaphor

### 

Metaphor must be taken into consideration or metaphors from a conlangerâ€™s own language will be unconsciously borrowed into the conlang.

* Lofez kon tomir li an mihiqa jetz - sleep that is alive
* The sheep has sleep that is alive (it is dreaming).
* Lofez tzito(mi)hiqa.
* The sheep dreams.

'lauschen' is such a pretty German word. It's more than listening, it implies that you are very quiet yourself and attentive. Etymologically it comes from being hidden (thus extending to secretly listening). 'lauschig' - cozy, secluded. It's almost onomatopoetic, if were to make an artificial cut (lau = mild, tepid; sch.... for hushed).

To cover & to hide are basically the same thing. *syk* is "the hidden thing" or "unseen thing". *miusyk* - hidden

Face / surface Get sciency here Use names for the interior if a cell or atom metaphorically. Nucleus of a song or book == its principal part. Contrast English uses "heart". Lakife also has *haru*, which could also mean nucleus.

Sleep soundly... sleep beside the silence of creation. Mitomir kon tix haraiz.
