I'm at Diner 24. That, in itself, is not surprising, since I was hungry after seraching for the **Steve Reich** boxed set called *Phases*. Searching for good music makes my tummy rumble and always has. I used to sift through the cd stores in New York City (Greenwich Village) for hours. I was faint from the effort. Once, Natascha had to pretty much carry me to the diner across the street and feed me forkfull by forkfull until I had regained my strength.

Yes, those were the days.

I just ordered *Phases*. I look forward to perusing the contents as well and indulging in the fantastic music for hours. The day it arrives will be consumed by the overlapping melodies.

I wonder why Justin does not like *Steve Reich*. He pointedly told me once that I should explore *Philip Glass* until my ventricles explode with delight, but to stay away from *Reich* for fear of clotting.
