I am on my bed in Jester Hall in Austin ... the University of Texas. John is not with me in the room. I am alone with his posters of Stryper and other hair-metal bands of the day. (Days long gone.) The chords Marty Willson-Piper fades in and out grip me with their raw value. I would say power, but this is not metal. Acy introduced me to this album and it remains etched even to this day. But I am flying to the future. I wonder were there days when I wandered around the campus listening to this very song - the whole album - as I did 'Pleasantly Disturbed' by Simple Minds. This is healing music, a reprieve from the loneliness which engulfs me. I drift from past to present tense. I suppose the latter is better. Other albums come to mind which had the same healing power. The aforementioned Simple Minds and 'Fugazi' by Marillion.

It is a commentary on progress and the way it rots closeness and intimacy. It is still valid to this day - an eternal hymn. There is no ambiguity. Our destination is self-oblivion and detachment from all who were or could have been close.
