Absurdly, as usual, I have chanced upon a possible conclusion as to why I was so attracted to Jana at first. (You must remember that this was 1 1/2 years ago.) Possibly one factor was because she was such an untalented smoker. Just like Vesna. Even Vesna's sister commented over and over again that Vesna had no style whilst smoking. Her cigarette hung clumsily in her fingers and her wrist tilted at awkward angles. When I first met Jana, in that pub with a name I cannot recall, when I ordered Lucky Strikes Lites, and offered to light her first, her hands stumbled like a child with her first violin. She took the flame so close to her fingers that I feared she'd scorch herself. As trivial as it might seem, it is not farfetched....
