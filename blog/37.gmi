# Song in Space
## Topics: change
## 2008-10-03

I am walking with my iriver playing insistently in my ears waiting for another message from Honeybunicka. It is the posh part of Dejvice. Near Podbaba. I walk often these days, often to rid myself of the alcohol which permeated endless (seemingly) hours before. My recovery phase.

She is my only deep contact at this time.

I send her a message (You can't spend the whole song in space). She replies with something along the lines of ... why can't you then spend it on earth?

I purchase a sandwich and head for the center, through Hradcanska.
