Ok, I am wating for this woman who seemes to care for me. I don't know what to do but write, a bit.

I'd like to listen to music right now. She doesn't at all. She called. She was missed. Of course, that is a lie, but I'll remember it.

I'm listenening to "Time" right now... As I tread the halls of sanity. Fuck! I am with Teresa again. Stupid girl. She should have been with me.

I think she was driving. We listened to this song. Fucking Fort Stockton. She was a good girl, though possibly possessed with an absurdity by believing that West Texas was the only place in the universe. Heh. Sort of like my parents.

I called her from El Paso, months later, and she smited me. She told me she was married. I guess I was depressed at the moment, and also from her words. I died a bit at that moment. I remember. I sat down and wrote music. I'm not sure if the music was good or bad, but that was the only thing I could do. She inspired so many things.

FUCK TERESA!

That's the way life's meant to be.
