    <title>On the Lip of the Agonizing Drop</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Lately, mornings have been painful yet fruitful. My early waking insomnia continues. I attempted to go to sleep last night at approximately midnight, and that worked well. I awoke several times during the night with a dry throat and wondered if I’d had too much sugar the day before, but could not recall what would’ve contained sugar that I’d consumed. I fell back asleep quickly each time. Came 6.30, however, and I knew it was all over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I sit in front of &lt;strong&gt;Tahr&lt;/strong&gt; (my Cirrus7 &lt;em&gt;desktop&lt;/em&gt; PC) and type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I added the part that Christian insisted on to &lt;em&gt;Motiv Dilerněkův&lt;/em&gt;, though the timbre and playing is somewhat different than the original track, but, hey, who wants to repeat themselves and / or attempt to clone past actions verbatim? Not me, honeybuničko. I also incorporated Rob’s &lt;strong&gt;F&lt;/strong&gt;. He apparently has a Chapman Stick and played a few of said &lt;strong&gt;Fs&lt;/strong&gt; on it and sent them to me to place wherever I wanted amid our album. I like the idea. He owns the record label, after all, so why not “demand” an amusing scenario where each artist has to place his single bass note at one or multiple positions on their release?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned sometime within the last 48 hours or so and in an entry in this very &lt;strong&gt;Martenblog&lt;/strong&gt;, a time of change has come once again. And thought it’s not exactly a &lt;em&gt;Sweet Entropy&lt;/em&gt; level of change, I will specify it as &lt;em&gt;Semi-sweet Entropy&lt;/em&gt;. The long and medium of it is that my parents need my help. They’ve been saying so for years, of course, and I’ve resisted. I shall migrate myself and much of my possessions to Seminole for a time to be there with and for them. Hopefully I won’t perish of aggravated and acute stress induced by my mother’s partial madness. I’ve written on that topic extensively in the past, so I won’t go into details now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I leave on the 31st, spend a night with John in Houston, then the next day, take the air carriage the rest of the way to Midland, where said parents will fetch me off to Seminole. Ah - the desert again! Well, it’ll probably be a relief from Prague’s hateful August humidity. Bastard climate. How long will I stay in West Texas (and the surrounding area)? I don’t know. Until I get sick of it, I suppose, which in the past hasn’t taken very long. Only &lt;em&gt;Semi-sweet Entropy&lt;/em&gt; knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On a distantly related topic, as I go through things to toss into the eternal garbage heap, I came across the following scribbling, probably done sometime during the first part of 2016:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
I used to think Vienna was the loudest place in the known universe, but I was incorrect. It is certainly Praha. They keep pounding and pounding. Well, really, what should I expect? Life is absurd, anyway. Time is a tempest. I miss Marisa so much now that I have cried. Where is she and what is she doing? I love her. I want to communicate, but I am blacked out. I know there is nothing. Fucking bastards. Funny. The reason I went to see Star Wars was because it was popular when I was a child. Funny that my phone was stolen during the film. I guess I deserve it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m wrong about the timeline. That was written in December of 2015, in the cheap hotel near &lt;em&gt;Bertramka&lt;/em&gt;. I had no phone. As I scribbled - it had been stolen. I had no internet access. I had a few days before smashed the screen of my laptop whilst wondering the city out of my head. That was certainly a low point in my existence, especially when my nose started bleeding copiously on the morning I had determined I must finally leave. I finally got to the airport with a clot of blood plugging my left nostril, apparent to all. In my bleary state, I finally managed to purchase a new air ticket to Barcelona (Madrid was not available on that day - perhaps it had been temporarily removed from the universe) and from there took a six or seven hour bus (I don’t recall) to Logroño, struggling with alcohol withdrawal and acute boredom and then finally arriving in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I would prefer to never repeat such things. The intensity of my solitude during that “sojourn” was near debilitating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So what’s the plan for the rest of the day? I meet Michal at 18.00, possibly dine with him, then see Nils Petter Molvær at some &lt;em&gt;sala&lt;/em&gt; near Karlovo Náměstí. It will be &lt;strong&gt;pleasant&lt;/strong&gt;. Until that time, I’ll practise what I’ve come to think of as a guitar, program, and walk through the neighbourhoods suffusing the three kilometre radius radiating from my current (but not for long!) place of residence.&lt;/p&gt;

Kenji Kihara weaves a tapestry of sound about the room as I type into an (almost) empty Vim buffer once again. It’s been quite a while, or so it seems. The impetus for this entry was actually my joining of a small &lt;em&gt;Virtual City&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;strong&gt;Nightfall City&lt;/strong&gt;. I sit disconsolate on the moors of &lt;strong&gt;Dusk’s End&lt;/strong&gt;, or rather, any entry that ends up in my Gemini feed does. Can blog entries be disconsolate? I posit that they can emit a sensation of disconsolateness. I’m not sure this one will achieve such a feat, however, as I’m rather bleary from only four to five hours of sleep during each night of the last week and a half. Big fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As far as social media and &lt;em&gt;Virtual Cities&lt;/em&gt; go, I’ve been pleased over the last few years with the Sonomu.club community on Mastodon. I’ve found like-minded humans (and possibly mustelids) there who share love for music and poetry and are purveyors of positive reinforcement as opposed to the good old American &lt;strong&gt;negative&lt;/strong&gt; reinforcement I grew up with and which pervades much of what I’ve seen of Western Culture. Oh, the psychopathy of passive aggressive manipulation and &lt;em&gt;chantaje emocional&lt;/em&gt;. Big fun!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As for the colossal changes that are about to crescendo in my life, I’ll get to them soon. I simply wanted to add an entry like stabbing a small flag into the crest of a moor before I rise again to walk to the next, even higher one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Gluey Mystery</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/531.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/531.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
My coffee consumption this morning has possibly not been healthy. I can feel the jittery roughness in my mind from over-caffeination. Yesterday was much the same, but from a combination of black tea throughout the day and a &lt;em&gt;shot&lt;/em&gt; of Michal’s special cold brew coffee. Replacing one addictive substance for another doesn’t seem very intelligent. In my case, that’d be replacing alcohol with caffeine. The concept reminds me of Christian and his nicotine gum. I shall limit myself to two &lt;em&gt;servings&lt;/em&gt; of caffeinated beverage a day for a while to see if it deletes the mind fuzz that comes from over-consumption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Last night, whilst going through what results in picking exercises but also what will result in the actual part in a new composition, I fought with myself psychologically because what I was playing was too &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;/em&gt; or somesuch. Well, it could be, but I do find the progression (and even the individual chords and their picking patterns) quite beautiful. It has that distinct sound that comes from adding 9ths to many but not all of the chords in a series. The aural &lt;em&gt;shock&lt;/em&gt; of 9ths not being in some of the transitional chords (mostly quartals) is where the gluey mystery comes from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I fought with myself. Mentally. My lifelong desire to &lt;em&gt;break from the mould&lt;/em&gt; is still present. It has not diminished a whit. This contradicts my so-called &lt;em&gt;purpose&lt;/em&gt; for Flavigula. What is that purpose? It’s to make music that &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; enjoy. As I’ve mentioned before, all this hovno I put to “tape” is ultimately for me to drown in during my decrepitude when I am broken and alone living in a shack in Ulaanbaatar. Others’ appreciation is a bonus. A very pleasant bonus, indeed, but, in the end, just a bonus. The trouble I have psychologically is that this perpetual &lt;em&gt;rebel&lt;/em&gt; that some fundamental module of my being carries around with it like a banner second guesses every thing I do creatively. In a way, it asks me - &lt;em&gt;What would Chris Cutler (or fill in whichever avant-garde artist you wish) think of this?&lt;/em&gt;. That’s ridiculous, of course. I mean, fuck um. Who cares what some arbitrary avant-garde artist would think of my output? If my hara spews forth a chord sequence and picking pattern that that contentious module immediately labels &lt;em&gt;conventional&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;pretty&lt;/em&gt;, why should I listen? That module needs to quiet itself. Sure, it’s useful in some contexts, but in this particular one, I find it detrimental. Bastard thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, I’m going with the chord sequence and picking patterns I’ve developed during the last few days. The whole thing is rhythmically interesting because I’m playing straight triplets over 90bpm, but the picking cycle is a sequence of 4. I also toyed with a sequence of 5. These provide nice cyclical polyrhythmic sensations. As I lay in bed before drifting to troubled oblivion last night, I figured I could provide sequences of 6 and 7 for the picking cycles, as well, going &lt;em&gt;up the ladder&lt;/em&gt; in a way. The &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt;, since I’m playing triplets, will be the most conventional and perhaps where I should give Michal his guitar solo. I look forward to what he comes up with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A additional idea is to thurk synth sequences “out of time” (at least accent wise, or even metrically - say doing 2, 4 or 5 against the triplets) as counterpoint as the piece proceeds. I’m not yet to that stage in my thinking, except for vaguely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today I may piece together a rough sketch of the whole in Ardour. Of course this depends on if I am devoured by a grue or not on my way to Kaufland after my shower. I have been told throughout my lifetime that grues lurk generally in darkness, but I rarely believe what I’ve been told throughout my lifetime by much of anyone. Deceivers are rampant in this thorn strewed universe. One best watch out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The slight heart palpations from the caffeine are waning. Soon it will be time for a shower then off to be consumed by a grue. Let’s hope that this last entry in Martenblog will remind the universe that though mental modules waving the flag of &lt;em&gt;rebellion&lt;/em&gt; are useful in many contexts, they should, like all things, be tempered with the “middle path”.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Having Grown Up Pains</title>

I got what I wanted, after all. And what was that? I got what I wanted - to be alone. And here I sit on the bed in James’s guest room, alone with the eidolon who writes words into this online journal. He pops up from time to time, but not as frequently as I’d like. Of course, James is in the other room, so I am not as “alone” as I will be in less than a week when I move to my own flat, and if I really wanted to, I could walk over there and talk to him, but I don’t think it’d quell my mental storm. Or perhaps it would, but only for the instants the talk lasted. Then I’d be back here, sitting in the bed in James’s guest room, alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The primary question of interest is &lt;em&gt;Was it worth it?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My talk to Marisa today was bewildering. It went against the resolutions I made to myself when I woke up on the morning of 28 March and quickly organised my things in anticipation of Dani’s arrival to whisk them and myself away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What was that resolution? It was to never look backwards. It was to proceed from then on hour by hour facing forwards. Perhaps it was an idealistic outlook, denying my existence as an emotional beast. Emotional in part, though surely not as much as I was 20 years ago, but emotional in part. Or I have learned to manage my emotions more pragmatically. The end result is the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, many conflicting emotions whorled during the conversation. They are still astir. Hopefully I’ll be able to sleep later. This was the first time since my departure that she’s been genuinely angry. I suppose the &lt;em&gt;ancient&lt;/em&gt; psychological thesis is right, in part. First disbelief and grief. Then comes anger. She claims I simply used her, from the beginning, to get European residency and to solve the many personal problems I had dragging behind me like anvils. I do admit that she helped cure me of a dire obsession with my interior life and the results of that obsession, including overindulging in the drink. I also know that were it not for the stability I had within the relationship and &lt;em&gt;homespace&lt;/em&gt;, I would not have had the courage to begin composing and performing music again. The relationship brought myriad positive things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Although we did many fantastic things together and I have numerous happy memories, in the end, as always, the stagnation crept in. Is it my eternal “curse”? Perhaps I’ll always feel stagnant no matter where I am or who I am with. As much as I’d like to be in complete control of the so-called modules that flow and interact within my &lt;em&gt;headspace&lt;/em&gt;, I have never been in control of the one that feeds me the impulse to &lt;em&gt;move on&lt;/em&gt;. So, I can honestly say that in the end, the fault is all mine. So when she called herself a victim during our conversation, or, rather, she said she &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; like a victim, she is one. One could even say that she is a victim of caprice. That is a dire way to put it. She is a victim of my caprice. She is a victim of Sweet Entropy - that uncontrollable module hovering, flitting and all the while scheming in my &lt;em&gt;headspace&lt;/em&gt;. So, consequently, Tony was right when he said it all those years ago. I am very capricious, not to mention selfish - at least in this context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But if the alternative is lifelong deep inner dissatisfaction, what is one supposed to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I know what she would say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Go to the psychiatrist and have them prescribe anti-depressants. Anti-depressants. And I also wrote her in a message a few days ago how afraid I am of such chemicals. I’ve seen how much Chris Bender has changed simply because of them. There are remnants of his creative, wacky and incisive self still, but they are subdued. And that is what anti-depressants do. They take the edge off. More specifically, they &lt;em&gt;file down&lt;/em&gt; the edges of your personality. Oh, to be smooth! But I don’t want to be filed down. I don’t want to be smooth, nor do I want to be subdued. I want to be Bobbus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And that means that I have to move forward. And that is what I am doing. And that is what I shall continue to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roger Trigaux and the Canal of Fumbling Forms</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/522.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/522.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Concerning Roger Trigaux’s death:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Alas, one of my favourite composers has died. His music has been an assuaging and alarming factor in my life since 1998. During the latter years of the 90s, what some would call the &lt;em&gt;golden age of web pages&lt;/em&gt;, both &lt;em&gt;Univers Zero&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Present&lt;/em&gt; had crude websites up detailing this and that about each band and dubious information about current events. These sites also hosted samples of the music itself. I don’t recall actually listening to anything from the &lt;em&gt;Present&lt;/em&gt; at the time, though surely I did, but I was captured by what I felt was &lt;em&gt;mystical darkness&lt;/em&gt; in a fragment by &lt;em&gt;Univers Zero&lt;/em&gt;. In particular, it was the bit of &lt;em&gt;La Faulx&lt;/em&gt; as the chaos begins to subside at 8.50 and transforms into the beginnings of a theme on bassoon. Listening to that bit still takes me back to sitting at the antique computer that I STOLE from the Microsoft offices and being rapt by those sounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my young mind, &lt;em&gt;Univers Zero&lt;/em&gt; were not people, but wraiths incanting simultaneously forbidding and alluring rituals. The &lt;em&gt;mystical darkness&lt;/em&gt; image muted itself over the decades, though it still lingers when I listen to Heresie. I ordered the CD from (probably) Wayside in the spring of 1998. I still have every motif of &lt;em&gt;Jack the Ripper&lt;/em&gt; imprinted in my mind. Staying an entire night once at Microsoft to finish some forgotten task, I had it &lt;strong&gt;blasting&lt;/strong&gt; from my office. I wasn’t the only night owl and got a few curiously alarmed looks from passers by. The last piece, &lt;em&gt;Vous le Saurez en Temps Voulu&lt;/em&gt;, of which Roger was the sole composer, captivated me like the other two, and ESPECIALLY the ending bit. The instruments breathed like creeping things aurally surrounding me and exuding an exhausted refrain. I still love it. In fact, after the live version of Ersatz from the live disc of the 2014 release of &lt;em&gt;Le Poison qui Rend Fou&lt;/em&gt; ends, I shall put it on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t remember actually acquiring a disc by &lt;em&gt;Present&lt;/em&gt; until my visit to NYC with Magdalena in December 1999. At Downtown Music Gallery, after showing her of both &lt;em&gt;Triskaidekaphobie / Le Poison Qui Rend Fou&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Certitudes&lt;/em&gt; and asking her to choose based on the covers, I went back to Praha with &lt;em&gt;Certitudes&lt;/em&gt;. Admittedly, it took me longer to get into the music than I first thought it would. And admittedly, the reason was the vocals. They were certainly difficult to digest. These days, though, &lt;em&gt;Delusions&lt;/em&gt; blows me away every time, INCLUDING the lurching, rasping vocal saturated first half. I haven’t given the rest of the album as much time as &lt;em&gt;Delusions&lt;/em&gt;, but will revisit the whole thing in the upcoming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My true obsession with the band came when I received the next album, &lt;em&gt;No 6&lt;/em&gt;, in early summer 2000. My days became saturated with it. I imbibed and re-imbibed every phrase. It’s brilliant. I don’t go back to it as often as I should, and that’s most likely because the long pieces are cut up into parts. I have an assembled version that I made ages ago, 320 kb/s mp3s. So what I wrote isn’t really an excuse, is it? I’ll thurk it onto my phone now. Done. I saw them play &lt;em&gt;Ceux D’en Bas&lt;/em&gt; at both shows I attended, and &lt;em&gt;The Limping Little Girl&lt;/em&gt; at the first. I still remember Kerman yelling &lt;em&gt;Didn’t you hear what your mother said?!?&lt;/em&gt; and Vesna looking at me with wild eyes. In fact, she loved the concert. Take &lt;strong&gt;THAT&lt;/strong&gt;, all you other girlfriends / wives that have made me suffer through countless hours of mindless pop and classic rock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Delusions&lt;/strong&gt; from Certitudes reminds me of sitting on a couch in mine and Vesna’s flat in Mũnchen smoking pot along and listening … just listening. Vesna was out somewhere. Our relationship was in its final days, so I don’t think I was too bothered. In any case, I was stoned and listening to Present, so all was well. A few months earlier, we were in Würzburg at the Freak Show Festival seeing the band. I hung out with Dave Kerman during Magma, him notably telling me that &lt;em&gt;Theusz Hamtaahk&lt;/em&gt; is his favourite because of its &lt;em&gt;compositional curve&lt;/em&gt;. I spoke with Roger briefly about the opening band (Anekdoten) and near the end of the evening again when he signed my &lt;em&gt;High Infidelity&lt;/em&gt; CD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That gig was a long time coming, actually. In the frat house I lived in with Vesna during the early fall of 2000, I scoured the internet using Nataša’s bumbling PC (that’s Nataša of &lt;em&gt;Linux is not so difficult. Actually, it’s the same, just in green&lt;/em&gt; fame) for where the purported concert was going to be held. As I noted earlier, their website at the time was sketchy. Dates and venues changed as frequently as Nataša changed boyfriends. The process continued until fruition in June of the following year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most fruitful event of the Freak Show Festival was meeting Frederick, however. Unfortunately, I lost touch with the blond, bearded Norwegian addict of Italian Prog Rock long ago. We took him back to München with us, and fed and housed him for a few days. I acted as &lt;em&gt;tour guide&lt;/em&gt; of the city. Imagine that. He introduced me to Franco Battiato and Pharoah Sanders. I introduced him to After Crying. Hardly a fair trade, was it? Well, he had free food and shelter, so fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Returning to the subject of frequency of listening, Maloja tells me that Present has only been in my top fifty in 2011, 2014 and 2015. This could be because of the length of their pieces or simply that they demand attention when one listens. Most of the peasants I know who wander through local fields of existence usually throw on music (sometimes in the form of a pseudo-aleatory radio station) to fill up the space around them. It produces a sort of familiar clutter that lets one sit more comfortable amongst otherwise stark environs. Putting on Present instead produces circling, semi-sentient forms instead of familiar clutter. These forms poke and prod at you. Comfort was never the goal of Roger’s vision. A tenebrous solace, maybe, but never comfort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Promenade au Fond D’un Canal&lt;/em&gt; begins it’s 20+ minute oppression regime and I again think back. The first time I listened was at John’s in Queens. And &lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;/strong&gt;, Nataša was there. Well, it’s possible I have the years mixed, but according to a previous paragraph, I bought &lt;em&gt;Certitudes&lt;/em&gt; on my Xmas 1999 NYC adventure, so I most likely grabbed &lt;em&gt;Triskaidekaphobie &amp; Le Poison Qui Rend Fou&lt;/em&gt; the following year. The wild part that just began parading from my speakers made John shout “23/16!” or some other absurd time signature. It’s not actually in 23/16. I’ll leave it up to the reader and future Present listener to figure out the actual time signature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mr Trigaux’s music is a passenger sitting at my side, poking and prodding, as I casually drift towards the place to which he’s recently gone. I’d like to think of that place as a sort of endless canal through which march fumbling forms who grunt and wail from time to time in 23/16. I look forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disassociation by Abstraction</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/528.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/528.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Lately, and possibly because I’ve been reading the book &lt;em&gt;Sapiens&lt;/em&gt;, I’ve been musing over imagined social constructs and their different levels and interconnectedness. The books relates that all social constructs are birthed from human imagination. I’ve had this thought before, as well, and actually discussions with my long lost friend Jayson on the very topic. I’m unsure if we put it as succinctly as the book has, however. Congratulations to the author. In recent years, I have referred to the whole scumduggery as bubble-think and the bubble-think I’m most interested in now is that of &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The shibboleths of large familial clans are, to me, the most dangerous. They tend to attempt to enforce their own bubble-think on anyone entering their realm, even temporarily. They come to believe their way of dealing with every day events is the &lt;em&gt;norm&lt;/em&gt; for the rest of the next-level-up shibboleth (usually a political group such as city or state) and come to question why outsiders perform daily tasks in any way &lt;em&gt;differently&lt;/em&gt;. In other words, they become their own fundamentalist bubble concerning daily routines. Those who try to escape from a familial bubble are questioned and sometimes castigated. They are certainly gossiped about. In fact, intra-bubble gossip is what most tightly holds a familial bubble together. Bonds are stronger when people have common negative views to “trade” with each other about others behind their backs. Assholes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I put the word &lt;em&gt;trade&lt;/em&gt; in quotes because what the intra-bubble denizens are doing is not actually &lt;em&gt;trading&lt;/em&gt;, as they share the same negative views. Rather, they are mutually reinforcing them. It’s another feature of bubble communities (though not so much for the large familial clans type) that they contain mostly people with similar viewpoints and mutual reinforcement is a wheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Extended families are a problem for me not only because I’ve always pretty much rejected my own, but because the link that exists is such a transparent imaginary construct that at times I’m unbelieving that people choose family over others simply because they are &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt;. The bond of &lt;em&gt;blood&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;adoption&lt;/em&gt; is so limp, in my mind, that I am even offended when it happens (even if it has nothing to do with me). I take offense at the stupidity. I can’t choose someone I have little or nothing in common with over a friend that shares common interests, motives and ideas for existence simply because the imaginary construct of &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it is time to get some TEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actually, I was incorrect. &lt;strong&gt;NOW&lt;/strong&gt; is the time to get some tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve consumed over half of the mug of tea even before typing these words. What gluttony! Does the word &lt;em&gt;gluttony&lt;/em&gt; apply to liquids, as well? I’d think so. For example - &lt;em&gt;Christian is considered a glutton by his familial bubble for his consumption of uncountable light beers every evening. They don’t relate this opinion to him, however, but only to each other behind his back, as that is how the bubble-gossip works. Because of their shared opinions of Christian’s light beer gluttony, they are bound closer.&lt;/em&gt; The bubble walls thicken. Opacity threatens!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My dead cousin Amy once related an anecdote from my own familial bubble to me in 2002 or so (I’m assuming the date). We were possibly listening to Porcupine Tree. One never knows. She was 10 years my elder and therefore closer to the so-called adult circles. &lt;em&gt;Adult circles&lt;/em&gt; are simply other bubbles, still translucent, but always with a share of opacity, of course, within the familial bubble. Bubbles within bubbles. Bubbles like Venn Diagrams. All sorts of bubbles exist. She’d be allowed to sit with my mother and her mother (otherwise known as my aunt) as they gossiped about the &lt;em&gt;wild&lt;/em&gt; girls in high school and how their corrupting influence, being against the gossiping Christian ethic, should be stopped. The distaste for those &lt;em&gt;completely outside&lt;/em&gt; the bubble strengthens bonds within the bubble even more. It’s exponential and built of hearsay and imagined situations and is the source of all prejudice and, on a large scale, war. I suppose Amy was in high school at the time and probably knew more intimately the goings on of her peers. She became accustomed to the negative bonds and began unknowingly (or not) doing it herself later in life, relating to me what she didn’t like about some collection of agents outside our personal bubble as we drove around Dallas listening to Porcupine Tree and stopping from time to time at the Hare Krishna commune to gobble down tasty cuisine. Was I surprised that she was doing the very thing that she complained to me about, making her a hypocrite? No - I wasn’t surprised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
People love to use the word hypocrite as a derogatory term labelling others, but excuse their own actions that could fall under the same label. I term it &lt;em&gt;disassociation by abstraction&lt;/em&gt;. Since the number of connections one makes on higher and higher levels of abstraction are limited, the stopping point usually doesn’t envelop one’s own deeds. Ie, talking shit about peer groups behind their back can be viewed as slightly “wrong” (there’s those quotes again) because they are people who one spends time with frequently, but talking shit about random groups of people on the streets obviously behind their backs is okay because one rarely if ever associates with them. On some level of abstraction, of course, it’s the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Perhaps I Should Simply Make a Sandwich</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/519.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/519.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I mailed a box full of guitar pedals to James. Along with giving boxes and suitcases of things to Dani, it is one of the first tangible steps towards freedom from my current emotional stagnation. The impact on my local environs will be substantial. In fact, it already is. It keeps me awake. I’ve practised mental isolation enough that I can usually push the thoughts of how Marisa is going to feel aside, but I am still vulnerable, especially during times of food coma duress. Why &lt;em&gt;food coma duress&lt;/em&gt;? I think my mental state weakens when I am in digestive mode. As I wrote recently, &lt;em&gt;food coma duress&lt;/em&gt; is a phenomenon I did not experience in past epochs. Or, alternatively, perhaps I just didn’t eat as much. I don’t think that’s the case, however, as I don’t gorge myself like my poor, slothful friend Christian does. Since I do not breakfast, I am far more happy about my decision to depart from this narrowing ravine during the morning hours. I am free of digestive moods and mentally acute. Though when I suck down too much caffeine, I become slightly dizzy. I suppose that is normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Digitizing all of these old Sir Alfred IV tapes is also assisting me to loose myself from my semi-rooted Spanish years. As diversely bad as they may be, they pull at me from epochs past and their aleatory days. Idealising such times is probably a mistake, as I was mostly miserable during the 90s, or &lt;strong&gt;lonely&lt;/strong&gt;. Maybe &lt;em&gt;pining&lt;/em&gt; is a better word. Now that I’ve experienced the relationship trap time and again, I should divorce the 90s from their suffering and imbibe the memory of complete freedom that I had. I’m excluding the time with Brynn, of course, though there were moments, especially at Microsoft, that I was floating in the arms of Sweet Entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Soon I’ll be floating in the arms of Sweet Entropy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, pragmatic steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Progressively send guitar pedals to James. If any of them are needed for &lt;em&gt;Cupboard of Moors&lt;/em&gt;, use them immediately in every required place. Put them in a box and mail them. I think the Mel9 and the Ditto x4 Looper will go first, as well as perhaps the Red Mountain Tremolo. Within 10 days, I can downsize to the main pedalboard and its supplementary THURK.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Everything that is not out in the open in my room goes in a box for Dani. He arrives tomorrow at 11. I have two boxes that I’ll build in the morning and then fill. There are cables, cassettes, a book or seven and other sundries that can be packed.  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Repeat until the bare essentials remain.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I must defecate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
James is searching for logistic companies that will get my boxes from here to Prague as cheaply as possible. I know it is possible do ship items this way, though I’ve never had the connections to do it before. Shall I trust James? Shall I simply murder him? Shall I trust him before murdering him? Should I pretend that I’m trusting him and then later pretend that I’m murdering him? The solution eludes me. Perhaps I should simply make a sandwich, enter a &lt;em&gt;food coma&lt;/em&gt;, give up my aspirations and metaphorically &lt;strong&gt;DIE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anything is possible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently, the four track tape that I used to record &lt;em&gt;Stone Calendar&lt;/em&gt; is being digitised. Excellent. As I was practising guitar “along” with it for a bit, it seems that it is exactly half speed. &lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt; is probably a vague term when I’m speaking of a 20 year old tape, but that is neither here nor there, everywhere or consuming commodious pears. We’ll see what the result is when I mix the four tracks together. I’ve wanted to finish &lt;em&gt;Stone Calendar&lt;/em&gt; for epochs. Perhaps the time to do so is soon. That begs the question - on which album will you place it, vole? Well - I’m partially of the opinion that I can work on the &lt;em&gt;Songs&lt;/em&gt; album and another album in tandem. What is this &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; album, you ask? It’s the one that originally was going to house &lt;em&gt;Sketch #1&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Sketch #3&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Sketch #4&lt;/em&gt; (and at one time, &lt;em&gt;Drtič&lt;/em&gt;). Instead, what about the three sketches and &lt;em&gt;Stone Calendar&lt;/em&gt;? Every piece will exceed ten minutes, so the resultant length should be about right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ok - so what do we place onto the &lt;em&gt;Songs&lt;/em&gt; album? No, I’m not going to suddenly become John Greaves and actually name the album &lt;em&gt;Songs&lt;/em&gt;. How about &lt;em&gt;Canciones&lt;/em&gt;? Ha! &lt;em&gt;Písničky&lt;/em&gt;. Ha ha! By moving the &lt;em&gt;Sketches&lt;/em&gt; to another album, I’ll have far more space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
The Penultimatum  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Union  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Pony Ride  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Fool Fancying Cliches (lyrics rewritten in Lakife?)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Get Away  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
That’s not enough. Other contenders could be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Write a new song! Ha!  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Cover of a Tony-era Alfred song  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Early Morning Madrigal  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Another Lee song (Running Circles?)  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A problem with doing many more early Alfred songs would be that I’d feel weird not asking Tone-tone to do bass and him playing bass would probably break up the album’s continuity. Possibly in the future, Tone-tone and I can actually do a Re-Alfred album, sort of like Albert Bouchard’s &lt;em&gt;Re-imaginos&lt;/em&gt;, without the pun, of course, though I’m sure Tone-tone would come up with an appropriate pun. It’s his gift and curse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, there is &lt;em&gt;Test Tube Conceived&lt;/em&gt;. I already mentioned the idea to Tony, so I’d presumably ask him to do bass and possibly vocals. I’ll place that project a bit apart from other Flavigula stuff for the moment, even though I need to keep it in mind and from time to time work towards its realisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Oh, and the electro-acoustic album! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whatever Gushes from my Hara</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/529.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/529.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I’m digitising a cassette that I recall nothing about. It’s something Tony sent me ~20 years ago, possibly slightly less. The first piece is simply bass punctuations over a warbly synth. In fact, I like it. The stark minimalism is appealing. Funnily enough, were I to do this sort of thing, I believe it would get approval from the &lt;em&gt;crowd&lt;/em&gt;. Not that I’m necessarily looking for approval, but I have found that the more minimalistic my output is, the more (at least immediate) positive feedback I get. This makes sense on one level because minimalism is initially easier to digest. Jēmeraz had a lot going on in the backdroop. Most people in this epoch of miniscule attention spans don’t have attentive energy enough to pay active mind to pieces of music multiple times. In fact, most people in this epoch of miniscule attention spans don’t have enough attentive energy to pay active mind to pieces of music ONE time. I hope I am wrong, but most just put on music as a backdroop to other activities unless attending a concert or, in the current plague epoch, a &lt;em&gt;live event&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The cassette and its minimalism continues. I wonder what it would take for me to get back to so-called &lt;em&gt;basics&lt;/em&gt; like this. Simple themes, weird experimentations in the backdroop, no thought of what anyone would &lt;strong&gt;THINK&lt;/strong&gt; about it. Those were the days of Sir Alfred IV and the cassettes. No matter what I say to myself and others, of course it is true that at least a few of my mental modules consider the opinions of others when I am creating music. Well, perhaps the ones that &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; consider others’ opinions are &lt;strong&gt;shut down&lt;/strong&gt; when writing the music itself, but certainly they are in a semi-wakeful state whilst I am manipulating the sonic space inhabited by the music. This is commonly called &lt;em&gt;mixing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;mastering&lt;/em&gt;, for those of you stuck in the Pleistocene, better known as the age of four track cassette recorders and an attitude that didn’t extend to caring about what any part of the populace might think. Pure experimentation, honeybuničko.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s still within my capabilities. For the “next” album, of course. How many “next” albums are there, anyway? Let’s add one highly experimental one to the list that will not take into account the hypothetical thoughts of any part of the populace, including anyone &lt;em&gt;close&lt;/em&gt; to me. I’ll designate this to the purely electronic album I was considering the other day. Let’s say it’ll turn out to be a combination of electronic and electro-acoustic. Ah, but now I’m giving it labels! That’s already a trap! Fuck um. Let’s say that it’ll just be experimental. Whatever gushes from my hara will be the result, and I’m not talking about improvisations, which seem lately to take on a sheen of &lt;em&gt;produced ambience&lt;/em&gt;. Listening to Tony’s cassette, I hear unbridled creativity. He did whatever the fuck he wanted to do. What I end up doing will sound nothing like this, of course, but I want the &lt;em&gt;wraith&lt;/em&gt; of the cassette age to be in evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On a tangential topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t want to leave albums in the queue forever. The so-called &lt;em&gt;songs&lt;/em&gt; grouping of pieces should be next, including Sketch #s 1, 3 and 4 along with recreations of Union, The Penultimatum and Pony Ride. My notes call attention to &lt;em&gt;A Fool Fancying Cliches&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Get Away&lt;/em&gt;, as well. Let’s leave those two for a future album.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What about &lt;em&gt;Drtič&lt;/em&gt;? I’ll continue with the idea of “releasing” it with &lt;em&gt;Cycle&lt;/em&gt;. I also toyed with the idea, and actually went as far as to query Kris about is drummer compañero kapely, of having a real drummer. If so, I’ll likely have to pay Martin. That’s cool, of course, but the bulk of the two pieces should be recorded in a form that doesn’t suck before I do that. At one point, I envisioned this being complete in 2020. Ha! One eternal rule is that all creative efforts take longer than planned, especially if Christian is involved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the cassette continues, I must think about my way to achieve experimentation without expectation. A good starting point is, of course, Supercollider, as well as manipulated samples and unorthodox (for me) use of SBUP. Another consideration is listenability &lt;strong&gt;for me&lt;/strong&gt; in the future. After all, in the end, all of this music I’m committing to digital media is for my own perusal when I am decrepit, drunk and dying in a pool of my own vomit in the distant future. It’s the perfect way to ride out my final days in the hovel I dig for myself in Ulaanbaatar. Who needs love and affection when one has dulcet (and clashing) musical hovno to caress one’s ears? Eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I turn over the cassette and am presented with a sound collage - another staple in electroacoustic music and therefore another idea. As much as I despise multi-tasking, it may be worth it to write the experimental album over a long period, adding things from time to time to compositions and letting them take shape more or less themselves during my nightly &lt;em&gt;listening sessions&lt;/em&gt;. These &lt;em&gt;listening sessions&lt;/em&gt; usually bear as much or at times more fruit than actually sitting with my guitar and looper &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Time to sign off for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mounds of Comestibles</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The final day of February finds me pining for escape. Food is a serious detriment to this goal, however. Lately I’ve noticed just how much consumption affects my daily moods. I was never cognizant of it before, or the effects were less or did not exist at all. Is this a question of age? I’d suspect so. It could also be a question of stasis. I’ve been in a sort of stasis since 2018. I’ll date it to when I abandoned my music work with Mikel. I still agree with my decision to not work with him any longer, but my subsequent situation was one of self-isolation. I have been very productive, true, but at what price? Time has drizzled by and only vague shapes from that four years of drizzle have left impressions on me. Yes - I’ve been immersed in my music and to a lesser extent my writing, but visions of the remainder of the universe are fleeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What does this have to do with food? Nothing. It was a tangent. I’m becoming a decrepit old man that cannot continue an idea to its completion, who is time and again distracted by tangents. Instead of directing my own thoughts, they direct me. In fact, that is what food does! I reach back and grasp the thread. Food is a thought dispersal apparatus. It prevents focus. Well, at the time of consumption, of course, the focus still remains, and it is decidedly on the food itself. The process of digestion is the &lt;em&gt;matador&lt;/em&gt;. Bastard digestion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each day fluctuates between potency and laxness, an exponential curve between each of them. In fact, after the two waffles I consumed, laxness is consuming &lt;strong&gt;ME&lt;/strong&gt;. Much like playing guitar when in &lt;em&gt;lax&lt;/em&gt; mode, I miss notes, I grope for words, I lose focus. I observe it slipping away as I type at this instant. What a phenomenon! So what is the solution then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, I should have just eaten one waffle. Not two. I shall pursue this strategy during &lt;em&gt;comida&lt;/em&gt;. I do not want the day to be a series of uselessnesses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Even more alarming is that when in &lt;em&gt;lax&lt;/em&gt; mode, I have little or less desire to escape from my cage. The cage of Logroño, where I waste away. I want to curl up in bed and read. No wonder the revolutionaries of the word were always malnourished. Fasting brings desire for change. It promotes an active brain. Before my brain ceases all movement, and it is threatening to at this moment: I don’t want to indicate that the situation is black and white. Though the catholic attitude is prevalent culturally here to the extent that it is playing out in the background of most everyone’s lives, religious or not, the food phenomenon I’m describing is not black and white. If I consume moderately at mid-day, I am just as vital. There is a tipping point, however. Perhaps this, too, is a vague line, but nevertheless one that exists. I cannot cross it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve already crossed it this morning, however, and shall go back to bed and read for a while. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Few Items that Resonate</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/518.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/518.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I’ve started a new &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt;. One might ask what that &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; is. One would get a reply immediately. At the end of each endless, torturous day I sit down with my trusty log-book and pen a few items that resonate most clearly in my mind from throughout the day. One can substitute &lt;em&gt;Fairphone&lt;/em&gt; for log-book and &lt;em&gt;virtual keypad&lt;/em&gt; for pen. Further, one can substitute &lt;em&gt;agonizingly brief and routine, but far from painful, unless one counts metaphorically&lt;/em&gt; for endless, torturous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Paying attention to my surroundings at as many moments as possible has been one of my lifelong goals - a hard won goal - one I’ve actually not even come close to “attaining”. It’s an objective in progress, then. If I have to train my log-book to signal me reminders to do so multiple times during each agonizingly brief and routine day then so be it - I shall do so. Remind Bobbus to be mindful of his environment - to be WITHIN his environment - not lost in some dreamland. &lt;em&gt;I could have been a dreamer!&lt;/em&gt; Ha. I want to be as far away from a &lt;em&gt;dreamer&lt;/em&gt; as possible. Soak up the atmosphere of each moment, vole, no matter how mundane! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What has initially shocked me about this new &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; is how little I can remember every evening. Let me be more clear. What has initially shocked me about this new &lt;em&gt;project&lt;/em&gt; is how many stand-alone lucid moments I can remember each evening. Of course, I remember swaths of events in general and how they proceeded, and even my general feelings about them at the time they occurred. When I have my trusty log-book in hand, these &lt;em&gt;feelings&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;event sequences&lt;/em&gt; resonate. These are not my concern. I want stand-alone lucid moments. Stills. I want mental photographs. These can include aural-graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For example, two late evenings ago, I scribed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
The eighth dotted quarter repeat bird call as I was sitting on the balcony with Marisa. She preferred another bird, who made a single  “more clear” ptweet.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt; is important. Its clarity is still with me now. I hope it will be in the epochs to come. These footholds into that day bring greater clarity to the remainder of the vague &lt;em&gt;sequence of events&lt;/em&gt; that surrounded them. As I said, I remember swaths of events, but without the central foci I am attempting to capture, the swaths will eventually, usually sooner than in some distant time, dissolve in the undulating ocean of my mind. Any impressions of them will be combined with multitudinous others. I can compare such designated daily foci with the &lt;em&gt;motifs&lt;/em&gt; of a piece of music. As much as I enjoy ambient music, endless blasts of white noise and improvisatory tomfoolery, music needs motifs for me to truly be &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; of it. They let me step onto a platform, no matter how tiny, so that the rest of the &lt;em&gt;entorno musicál&lt;/em&gt; can whorl around me. They let me be a part - to live within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So am I saying I want to relive each of these days I’m obtaining &lt;em&gt;foci&lt;/em&gt; from? Well, yes - every bit of my past that I can grok clearly gives me more insight into being alive knowledgeably. They will also give me ideas for future meanderings in the Martenblog, for the mind’s landscape is never quite completely explored. The more I remain a mystery to myself, the less I feel like I’m actually living. That brings me to another topic always hovering in the &lt;em&gt;backdroop&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Depression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Depression has cradled me in its niggardly arms, blocking out the rest of the known multiverse, from time to time throughout my existence. That’s fine. I’ve accepted it. But I do kick and poke and whack the beast with my personal sorts of offenses. One of these personal sorts of offenses is the foci I just explained. Letting the cradle of depression be my default place is equal to living any number of aforementioned &lt;em&gt;swath of events&lt;/em&gt; again and again without the foci. The foci undermine depression’s grip. They are the islands in my mind’s undulating ocean. Similarly, making music, writing in Martenblog and worshipping goats are all other methods of spitting in depression’s face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other people I’ve known have succumbed to medication to make the beast vanish. I argue that while these medications may make the beast vanish, it is still there, cradling. After medicating, it is simply not perceivable. A numbness arises and therefore the daily foci, the music-making, the writing and the worshipping goats are no longer necessary. I’ve tried the pills and related strategies. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One conclusion is that depression, at least for me, is actually &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt;. Or, rather, the battle against it is productive. I have no hard evidence that I’d not make music, write or worship goats if the beast did not exist. I can’t currently think of any other factors, but that’s probably because I need tea. I need tea badly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These Connections are Incidental</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/517.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/517.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I enjoyed thoroughly one of my favourite pieces of music last night. &lt;em&gt;Soubresauts&lt;/em&gt; by Univers Zero from the fantastic album &lt;em&gt;Clivages&lt;/em&gt;. I invited my friend to listen, as well. His opinion of the piece differed drastically from my own. Initially he queried if it was made in a DAW. He seemed shocked that it was a band. He said the recorded suffered from sounding like &lt;em&gt;banging on cardboard boxes&lt;/em&gt; and called one part &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt;, pathetic like &lt;em&gt;80s or 90s rock fusion&lt;/em&gt;. Now, I respect his opinion greatly, but I’ve never heard any of these facets in &lt;em&gt;Soubresauts&lt;/em&gt;. But, in the end, that’s fine. I listened to the parts he pointed out again trying to discern what he was hearing. I failed. Why? The reason could be that I have heard the piece multitudinous times, but I don’t think so. I believe it is the approach with which each of us listens to something - at least initially. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m fascinated by harmonic and rhythmic interactions. The “presence” of the recording in reference to it sounding like it’s in a room, a hall, a vacuum chamber or a foreign star system is immaterial initially to me. I ignore it. This may stem from the fact that I’ve spent epochs of my life listening to “badly” recorded music, not to mention bootlegs of live recordings. The “presence” of the recording comes to me later usually, after I’ve absorbed the harmonic, melodic and rhythmic details. I posit that it is similar to the fact that the weather doesn’t affect me at all. Sure, I sense and know that it’s hot, tepid, cold, freezing, raining, sleeting, slowing, howling with demonic winds, etc., but the sensation and knowledge do not change the way I go about my day. They colour the way I go about my day, maybe, but overtly change it, no. I’ll incorporate my sense and knowledge of the weather, if only subtly, in what I do. The “presence” of a recording is much the same. I sense the way something is recorded, but it rarely affects how I approach the music. Or, using the weather analogy further, I may move through the music slightly differently depending on the “presence”, but I carry on through it, regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One could then ask - Bobbus, why don’t you just listen to midi files run through a generic synth to grok these things? Well, the timbrel variety that comes with wielding an actual instrument interests me greatly, as well, and thereupon creates the fourth facet of music that fascinates me: texture. I understand that texture can be closely related to the aforementioned “presence” or production value of a recording. Narcissist assholes speak of using the studio as an “instrument”. I get it. But back to the original theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My friend and I obviously differ in our approach to listening and I believe we also differ in our expectations during a listening session. Despite what myriad of my friends, ex-friends, lovers, ex-lovers, family members, ex-family members and always present bacterial colonies think, I don’t require music to be completely bizarre for my enjoyment. I seek the middle path in all things. I don’t need something to be overtly avant-garde to be thrilling. I derive joy from jazz standards, string quartets, progressive rock epics and folk ditties alike. Well, I derive joy from selections that fit into each of those categories, of course, and obviously not EVERYTHING. The point is that I don’t openly reject something just because it seems to be “fitting in” to a specific genre. And so - it bothered me when my friend claimed that a section in &lt;em&gt;Soubresauts&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt;, pathetic, blah blah blah. The section is question brings me joy and even if it DOES evoke to someone 80s American rock or whatnot (I personally don’t hear it), I highly doubt Daniel Denis planned the piece out so that those phrases would FIT that template. No. I’m not saying that said friend necessarily asks for something ‘avant’ every time he listens. It’s doubtful that anyone is so extreme. Approaching any art with expectations is a danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve encountered a certain point of view especially with other musicians many a time during my patchy existence. Immediately these people will latch onto a phrase or even a sound, timbre or single chord and pinpoint where they have heard it before. The rest of the piece, especially the context, is then abandoned. And in most music, excepting pastiches and satires, these connections are incidental. When I’m composing something, I don’t sit back and re-analyze - does this sound like such and such or such and such that has already been done in the past. Hm - maybe this sounds too &lt;em&gt;American&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ukrainian&lt;/em&gt;. Should I change it to create something more original? Being that the point of my music to to compose and record something that I’d personally like to listen to, I don’t see the point of such analyses. In any case, if one fights ANY sort of conformity (especially incidental conformity) in every step of the process of creation, it’s basically doing the same as conforming in every step of the process of creation. You’ve just done the opposite. You’ve made a sort of conceptual mirror image. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I re-listened to &lt;em&gt;Soubresauts&lt;/em&gt; a number of times trying to discern everything that pertained to our conversation last night. I guess i can see where my friend is coming from in places concerning the “presence”, but none of that changes the overall sensation, ebb and rush of the piece for me. It’s brilliant. In the end, opinions differ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One thing that we do agree about, and is reserved as a topic for wholly separate Martenblog entry, is that when something is strikingly different about a recording - in its “presence”, it makes us take notice, probably him more immediately than me, but still. Whether that difference is something I would incorporate into my own work is another matter entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t want to come off as creating a critique of my friend’s critique. I will incorporate his opinions in how I listen to music in the future. Sure. I’m forever changed! Every conversation should forever change me, actually. I do think I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; let the “presence” of a recording affect me more and not just let it “exist” as I do the weather, oblivious of the toll it takes on its environment. These considerations are especially important when they concern the music that I write and record, as I am still in a constant state of learning when it comes to mixing and mastering.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Flasks or Rectangular Lasagna Dishes</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/514.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/514.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The manifestation of peasantry comes in many forms. It is impossible to avoid completely. It’s the tacit acceptance of the same five or six meals one dubs &lt;em&gt;favourites&lt;/em&gt;. It’s the same radio station every day on the way to and from work. It’s watching the same several of genres of TV shows every evening before sleep. It is closely related to comfort. In a way, being a peasant is conforming to comfort or, better, conforming to a comforting routine. Reticence to breaking out of so-called &lt;em&gt;comfort zones&lt;/em&gt; is what it means to be a peasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The English Breakfast is most likely steeped. My peasantry has me drinking it every morning these days. Or is simply drinking the same beverage (tea, in this case) every morning peasantry? Should I break from it and drink coffee or vodka some mornings? I’ll stretch my idea a bit and state that simply ordering different TYPES of teas each time I’m running low will absolve me of peasantry, at least in the tea zone. Logistical means have to be taken into account. I could, however, order a menagerie of teas and have a different one every day, chosen at random from a twenty sided die. It’s not a bad idea, actually. At what point would I be completely dissolving what I term as “peasantry”? I can spike the teas every morning with pinches of different spices. I can use different cups or indeed other types of containers - bowls, flasks, or rectangular lasagna dishes. At what point does fleeing from the concept of peasantry become another sort of obsessive-compulsive peasantry?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps the most important to me, besides absurd digressions concerning tea, are variations, even ever so slight, in all things. I once wrote in my ancient but still partially pertinent &lt;em&gt;100 Things About Me&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
Changes (even small, seemingly superficial ones) in my lifestyle invigorate me.    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I still subscribe to this “philosophy”. If routine is peasantry to me, then deviations, even ever so slight, abolish the peasantry. A &lt;em&gt;routine&lt;/em&gt; of constant, subtle deviation. I chuckle at myself. Speaking of which, it’s time to fill my cup with tea, or, rather, abandon the filthy cup I’ve been using for epochs on end and choose another, fresh cup, of a colour that invigorates my imagination, and fill it with tea. I shall do so now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I chose a red cup. The colour is not a brilliant red, but slightly washed out, like blood on the white tile spilled from a sample taken from an animal - a small animal, most likely a mink. I spiked the tea with Goat Milk, so my variance today is only in the form of a container. I shall do better, I promise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m listening to an improvisation done by a fellow sonomu-mate known as &lt;em&gt;June&lt;/em&gt;. It’s an exploratory &lt;em&gt;jam&lt;/em&gt;, an improvisation, to get to know a new case and / or modules and / or configuration of modules. I’m not clear on that part. Last night, I performed my first ambient guitar improvisation in epochs. Long, dark epochs. Endless, droning epochs! I began with no expectations at all, but given the simplicity of my &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt;, it came out fantastically. I concentrated on timbres between my two pedalboards, morphing long loops and listening to how they interacted. I even imposed a bit of harmony on the admittedly lugubrious result: I began firmly using C# melodic minor, centering on the augmented triad of E - G# - C, then slowly took the music into a more pure C# aeolean, changed the flat 6 (A) (again, very slowly) to an A# to create a sense of B major. From there, the drift was towards D major, or B minor, though it’s up to the judgement of outer entities whether I ever arrived. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
June’s exploratory improvisation has ended. I enjoyed it immensely and need to force myself to create something frequently on my boxes full of modules. All creation, no matter how infrequently, is deviation from peasantry. Also, improvising is a deviation from another routine of late - composition. I’ve immersed myself in work on the new album and perhaps the rigidity of specifying part after part, detail upon detail weighs on me. I propose to myself a balance between the freedom of exploratory improvisation and the strictness of composition. Where is the middle ground, one asks? That’s a good question. Truly, I used to take ideas from past improvisations and incorporate them into what became composed pieces. Eg, &lt;em&gt;Nomenclature&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Una Palma De Barro&lt;/em&gt;. And, again truly and lately, I’ve found myself doing something I promised myself I’d never do again - bang out parts without having heard the numerous contexts they could simmer in. Is it impatience? Is it peasantry? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Take each idea and at least use it as a vehicle for short, exploratory improvisations. This is harder on SBUP, but doable with sequencing. We’ll see if I follow my own advice today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Vanishing of Things Already Disappeared</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
My father phoned yesterday to inform me that my cousin, Amy, had perished in her sleep the previous night. Having stated that, I shall go make tea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I have returned. I walked to the kitchen, found the water in the kettle not yet to the point of boiling, so I did not linger. Soon, I shall check it again and achieve my momentary goal of beginning the process of creating tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, my father phoned yesterday to inform me that my cousin, Amy, had departed the &lt;em&gt;entorno&lt;/em&gt; of the living the previous night. Before I elaborate on my feelings concerning this, I shall check the tea-water again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I found that the tea-water had just finished reaching 100C, the adequate temperature for steeping English Breakfast tea. Thus, English Breakfast tea is now steeping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, my father phoned yesterday to tell me that my cousin, the oldest cousin I had, had become a corpse during the previous night. The last time I recall spending time with Amy was March 2013. I could be wrong about this date, but that detail isn’t very important, so I’ll leave it at March 2013. I spent the night at her place on the way, driving, from Seminole to visit Victor in some backwoods pseudo-city in east Texas. From there, I’d go on to Nashville to spend a month in Lisa’s apartment whilst she cared for her terminally ill mother. Amy and I drank whiskey and watched &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;/em&gt;. I also recall making her listen to &lt;em&gt;Present&lt;/em&gt;, which I am incidentally listening to right now. She claimed it gave her a headache or somesuch, which is perfectly understandable given the music’s relation to all things “contemporary” and even given Amy’s experience with 70s classic rock and even with a bit of weirdness. I don’t remember much else from the evening. The whiskey did its job well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It strikes me that since that evening, Amy has already been metaphorically dead for me in the sense that I have had absolutely no communication with her since. My parents mentioned things about her from time to time, but nothing stands out in my memory. Basically, the entity that was Amy “stopped” after that evening with &lt;em&gt;Present&lt;/em&gt;, whiskey and &lt;em&gt;The Departed&lt;/em&gt;. So do I mourn her departure (pun certainly intended) at this moment? No. I felt nothing upon hearing the news from my father. Nigh-eight years of absence had already released whatever feelings I had for her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of my cousins, she was the one I could relate to most, for sure. She was the most direct, the most “present” (pun certainly intended). This is in contrast to her sister, Emily, who was pretentious, backstabbing, passive-aggressive and scurrilous in general. From what I hear from my parents, still is. I still have psychological scars from relations with Emily during my childhood. Thusly, she’s been metaphorically dead much longer than Amy. I suppose the conclusion is that looking back, Amy was a positive influence in my life. I could relate many nostalgic anecdotes, but I’m sure most already exist elsewhere in this or some other journalling apparatus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I shall detail a single episode, actually. I had just purchased &lt;em&gt;In Absentia&lt;/em&gt; by Porcupine Tree and &lt;em&gt;Happy With What You Have to be Happy With&lt;/em&gt; by King Crimson earlier in the day. Amy and I were doing various errands around the Dallas area and we were stopped at a strip mall where I had run in to snatch something. I was re-entering the passenger’s compartment of Amy’s car. She was listening to the first of the two mentioned albums. We had been listening to it during the drive. As I sat beside her, &lt;em&gt;Prodigal&lt;/em&gt; was in progress. She told me she was glad I had got back in time as I was going to like the song. That was December 2002.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now I shall pour myself a cup of English Breakfast.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Kicking Google in the Teeth</title>

    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/510.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
So, I received my Fairphone 3 yesterday. Sure, I could have bought a Fairphone 3 &lt;strong&gt;Plus&lt;/strong&gt;, but I decided I’ll grab the camera and audio upgrades a bit later and install them myself. Why? Well - to get into the spirit of Fairphone! Open hardware! Imagine that! Fuck Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing I did was unlock its bootloader. This essential part of removing stock Android and placing a Google-less system on the phone is detailed here&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.fairphone.com/t/fp3-unlock-the-bootloader/53506&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^a&lt;/a&gt;. However, once I enabled developer tools, entered into developer tools, selected USB debugging and OEM unlocking, and navigated to the page&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fairphone.com/en/bootloader-unlocking-code-for-fairphone-3/&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^b&lt;/a&gt; describing how to get a so-called &lt;em&gt;unlock code&lt;/em&gt;, I encountered a problem. You may have already guessed what he problem was. The &lt;em&gt;unlock code&lt;/em&gt; I received after inputting my IMEI1 and Serial Number &lt;strong&gt;did not work&lt;/strong&gt;. The next three I tried also did not work. I was not deterred. Well, I would have been deterred had not I rooted around a bit on the web and discovered that the &lt;em&gt;unlock codes&lt;/em&gt; were generated by an algorithm that can be downloaded (a PERL script!). Additionally, a kind soul put a webified version here&lt;a href=&quot;https://public.z3ntu.xyz/FP3/verify-code.php&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^c&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;unlock code&lt;/em&gt; it generated worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I followed this&lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.e.foundation/devices/FP3/install&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^d&lt;/a&gt; up until the last instruction of step 2 in the section &lt;em&gt;Installing /e/ from the bootloader&lt;/em&gt;. I did not re-lock the bootloader. The reason will become clear soon. Anyone who is reading this and wants to go ahead and install Magisk (and TWRP) to root the phone will have to go through the whole ordeal of unlocking the bootloader once again &lt;strong&gt;IF&lt;/strong&gt; said human bought a phone with /e/os pre-installed or used the Easy Installer provided by the &lt;em&gt;e Foundation&lt;/em&gt;. Unlocking the bootloader will erase the accumulated narrative of said human’s existence, or possibly only the data on said human’s phone. Be warned! But - unfortunately, to continue, it is mandatory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, I performed everything up to the command that should not be entered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fastboot flashing lock&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
(prosím, do not execute this command because it will re-lock the bootloader)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In continuation - I booted into /e/os. No problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I grabbed the newest Magisk&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/releases/download/v21.1/Magisk-v21.1.zip&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^e&lt;/a&gt;, which actually isn’t the absolute newest, but peasants can’t be philosophers, can they? I also grabbed TWRP&lt;a href=&quot;https://eu.dl.twrp.me/FP3/twrp-3.5.0_9-0-FP3.img.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^f&lt;/a&gt; for Fairphone 3. Whilst in normal /e/os operation, I plugged the phone via usb (implying that I did not use a DB-25 over RS-232, for example) into my PC (Arch Linux). I pulled down the overlay menu from the top of the screen and at the bottom of the notifications, I was notified &lt;em&gt;Android System - Charging this device via USB&lt;/em&gt;. Tapping on the notification, I was told &lt;em&gt;Tap for more options&lt;/em&gt;, which I did. To be able to transfer the Magisk zip and the TWRP img to the phone using adb, I changed the USB preferences to &lt;em&gt;File Transfer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At this point, I assume that whichever human is reading this is already aware of &lt;em&gt;adb&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fastboot&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, this is most likely a faulty assumption. So, depending on platform, download and install these two tools. They are part of the Android SDK. On Arch Linux and its derivatives, they can be obtained with the &lt;code&gt;android-tools&lt;/code&gt; package. The commands I used to transfer the two files to my phone were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;adb push twrp-3.5.0_9-0-FP3.img /storage/emulated/0/Download
adb push Magisk-v21.1.zip /storage/emulated/0/Download&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The steps for getting TWRP&lt;a href=&quot;https://twrp.me/fairphone/fairphone3.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^g&lt;/a&gt; onto the phone were clear, but I read them through twice before starting because of problems I’d had in the past with bootloops. Ironically, the only part that &lt;strong&gt;seemed&lt;/strong&gt; to go awry was when I got to the paragraphs that read:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Once booted, navigate to the Advanced &gt; Install Recovery Ramdisk option. This will ask you to select the image you want to install TWRP from. Select the TWRP image you just downloaded and copied into device storage. Proceed to install this image.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
You also need to use the “Fix Recovery Bootloop” option present in the same Advanced Tab. Use that option after you have installed the recovery ramdisk successfully to avoid boot loops happening from installing TWRP Permanently.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I did both after performing a temporary boot into TWRP, but the second one - specifically about bootloops - gave me an error. But that did not matter. Everything worked. So don’t worry!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I backed out until I saw the &lt;em&gt;Install&lt;/em&gt; option in the upper left corner and pressed it. I then found the Magisk zip and installed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Rebooting the phone, I was back in normal /e/os operation. Magisk Manager was installed, rather magically, so I opened it, updated the manager, but NOT Magisk itself. At this point, I installed all my banking apps. I have two, specificaly - Revolut and CaixaBankNow. Neither would get past an opening screen without the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Install both apps but DO NOT OPEN THEM  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Open Magisk Manager  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Tap on the cogwheel in the upper right  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Find &lt;em&gt;Magisk Hide&lt;/em&gt; and activate it  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Immediately above this item is &lt;em&gt;Hide Magisk Manager&lt;/em&gt; or something similar  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Activate it and choose the new “name” of the app (just accept the default &lt;em&gt;Manager&lt;/em&gt;)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Back out and select the shield from the floating rectangle at the bottom  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Tap &lt;em&gt;MagiskHide&lt;/em&gt; and find my banking apps  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Tap um  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bliss was achieved.&lt;/p&gt;

My adventure yesterday with my Galaxy m30s ended in disaster! Yes! I didn’t even get to the “installing TWRP” part. Because said phone is famous for being difficult to modify and even though the bootloader has been unlocked since the dawn of the multiverse, flashing it was obviously not a good idea. I used these&lt;a href=&quot;https://topjohnwu.github.io/Magisk/install.html#samsung-system-as-root&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;^a&lt;/a&gt; instructions to patch the latest m30s firmware with Magisk so that Magisk could live in the recovery partition on the phone. On this magical Samsung device, Magisk can ONLY live in the recovery partition. And perhaps Magisk now DOES live within the recovery partition, but I’ll never know, will I? Why will I never know? Because the magical Samsung device is more concerned with bootlooping than what resides in its recovery partition! Yes! I followed instructions magnanimously, using the quaint &lt;em&gt;heimdall&lt;/em&gt; to do the flashing itself. No dice, as my mother would say. No puréed peanut butter and nanner sandwich, as erstwhile Scott Lentz would say. No heat death of the universe for you, as Shambal Brambel would say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I ordered a Fairphone 3. It arrives soon and whereupon I’ll begin a /e/os adventure. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

I’d really like to install LineageOS on my current phone - a Samsung Galaxy M30a - as I’ve been inspired once again to rid myself entirely of Google[^1]. I was nearly there next year. An olden phone, made of charred wood and reptile sinew, was running LineageOS. My only contact to Google was using IMAP to gmail. Alas! The universe conspired against me and I received the M30a as a gift. LineageOS was not available for it during that ancient October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before, of course, I could not thurk banking applications on LineageOS because it was considered “rooted”, even if it was not actually “rooted”. Bastards. At the time, it wasn’t an issue because web access was enough. Now, however, I use Relovut for much of my money doings in my contracted universe. Revolut refuses to function on my old Moto G5 which is still running LineageOS and, indeed, sitting at my side, atop a notebook of scribbled sheet music. I shall at this moment reinstall LineageOS on it from the foundations of its being and see if then, using some magical being called &lt;em&gt;Magisk&lt;/em&gt;, I can get Revolut to work. If so, I shall proceed tomorrow to destroy my M30a with LineageOS. May the great GOAT be praised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[^1]: The inspiration this time was the toot by @luka@sonomu.club about his move to the Fairphone 3+ (at lest I believe it was the Fairphone 3+, and I could easily check by changing desktops with &lt;strong&gt;Super-3&lt;/strong&gt; and looking over sonomu.club’s local timeline, but I refuse) with /e/os. I desire to do the same, but will wait until I am relocated to a more fecund plot of earth in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Better Way to Drift Through a Day</title>

A few days ago, I began the journey of migrating flavigula.net to &lt;em&gt;static-generated&lt;/em&gt;. So one could say that now my blog, music meanderings, poetry abominations and various other diddlings are now generated directly from the primal static of the universe. The primary file of code that accomplishes this feat is &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/Http.ex&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The generation “engine” (I laughingly call it an “engine”) is pretty specific to my personal needs. It could be generalised, but I’d have to have a pretty large dollop of impetus to follow through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Besides taking the blog entries from MongoDb and spitting them out using Elixir’s EEx templating library, my primary aim was to follow my Gemini site as closely as possible, mirroring it, más o menos. This involved parsing the Gemini files and attending to several peculiarities. One of those peculiarities that I’m particularly fond of is taking footnoted links and placing them within the html document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A practise from bygone epochs was to place links at the bottom of a page of content. The bygone epoch I refer to is circa 1993 or 4 when I starting writing text-only web pages. I only had a DUMB terminal in my apartment. Nope - no computer for me! I just used the DUMB terminal to dial up to Neosoft (a Houston ISP) and use my shell account there and at Texas A&amp;M University Statistics Department (via telnet, perhaps - did we already have openssl in that bygone epoch?). I had a guest account at said Statistics Department and, curiously enough, said guest account didn’t vanish from the &lt;em&gt;rostro&lt;/em&gt; of the internet until December 1999. In any case, I had a DUMB terminal. I connected to Neosoft, then to TAMU, and wrote text-based web apparati. Fun times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A practise from the initial throes of the web was instead of placing all links inline, to place the ones that would be obtrusive at the bottom of a page of content. I do exactly this on my Gemini pages. The challenge was to suck up all those links and relate them to their references within the page content. An example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On the main music page of flavigula.net and also on gemini://thurk.org/flavigula/index.gmi, the following line appears:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Secondly, the thurk.org funkwhale[f] is brimming with both current and antique Flavigula. These include Omnivorous Expanse[g] (also on Bandcamp[h]), a project with Tim Rowe, and Bricked-up Cupboard[i], a collection of tunes that may or not be refined for future “release”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At the bottom of the page are the following footnote links:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;=&gt; https://funkwhale.thurk.org f. Thurk.Org Funkwhale
=&gt; https://funkwhale.thurk.org/library/albums/14/ g. Omnivorous Expanse on Funkwhale
=&gt; https://timroweflavigula.bandcamp.com/releases h. Omnivorous Expanse on Bandcamp
=&gt; https://funkwhale.thurk.org/library/albums/7/ i. Bricked Up Cupboard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As the page is scanned, a map is built with the letters f-i referring to their line in an array (it’s not actually an array, but that’s not important). These lines are modified when matching footnotes are found. I played around with various configurations of text and link and finally found that since there was no easy way to place the anchor around the text the link referred to, I’d just place all the links unobtrusively at the end of each paragraph. I like the way it came out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/static/flavigula/index.html&quot;&gt;Main Flavigula Music Page&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m certain there are oddities and errors in my &lt;em&gt;static-generated&lt;/em&gt; implementation, but I feel I reached my objective. Well, since my objective was a very &lt;em&gt;fuzzy&lt;/em&gt; target, and I gave up on being a perfectionist long ago, I’m ecstatic. Oouh, baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another change from my vue-powered ex-site was ditching Bootstrap. Why? There is no why. I trundled through a few micro css frameworks and finally happened upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://jenil.github.io/chota&quot;&gt;Chota&lt;/a&gt;. I am very pleased with Chota. I encourage everyone reading this, and also everyone not reading this, to leap from the Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma or Ichthyosaur wagon and begin rolling anew with Chota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes sir ee.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Mundane, Tech-Oriented Entry</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/499.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/499.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I was supine and reading various Gemini feeds. I cannot seem to find the one I want to refer to with this entry, however, as the space is still slightly disorganised. Probably I took sloum’s Spacewalk page as a starting point, found an article about Gemini feeds that inspired me to update my own Spacewalk instance, got up, sat at Tahr (the mighty desktop!) and simply could not find said article again. That sent me on a quest. The quest has been a failure, but I did find another fault in my own Gemini Server setup. My pages recently used to all terminate in &lt;em&gt;.gemini&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;.gmi&lt;/em&gt;. If I search in GUS for &lt;em&gt;lakife&lt;/em&gt;, for example, I get a series of pages on thurk.org that have the old extension. What must I do? I must teach Molly Brown to rewrite Gemini urls. I shall add that to today’s “bullet journal”. I laughingly call what I do by hand a “bullet journal”. Anyway, that’s another topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I downloaded the Spacewalk software some time ago and added a collection of feeds that I could read through every few days - things of interest, not just technically, but in a sense of content itself. If Gemini-space remains wholly tech-oriented, even I would tire after some time. I have a systemd timer set up to re-launch (ie, update) my personal Spacewalk thrice a day. It’s a good enough start for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Metaphor for Listlessness</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/498.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/498.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
As the days creep towards the arbitrary division between one year and the next, I am somewhat culturally forced to think about a few things that I could pay more attention to in the upcoming cycle around our waning sun. I feel like I have grown apart from the “random”, or what I call in my personal shibboleth, and in the shibboleth that some close friend share, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Entropy&lt;/em&gt;. When aleatory ideas blow by on the breeze, I must catch them far more often than I do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe I used to catch these aleatory snatches more frequently, but one grows older - into decrepitude. One settles and becomes metaphorically sessile. The path to decrepitude is, ironically, sitting still, intellectually &lt;strong&gt;as well as physically&lt;/strong&gt;. This year’s quarantines have aged me slightly and I don’t like it one bit. Neither does Sweet Entropy, who is ever beckoning, normally subtly, but now with wild gesticulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do believe I used to snatch these aleatory breezes more often. Sometimes it is as simple as just taking notice of the thought as it passes in that occluded module of the mind that forms most of the daily background noise. It’s the antithesis of concentration, but upon it also floats those aleatory snatches I need to reach out and grasp. Mostly, they appear as response to outside stimuli - a fly buzzing in the speaker cone, or a shred of carrot hurled from a food processor. Instead of ignoring them as oddities or passing phenomena, each can lead to interesting pathways and eventually to fecund groves. Capture um, stick um in a book of notes (digital or no), peruse um again and again, unite um with current creativity, and let um shunt a creative thread this-a-way or that-a-way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, follow threads that appear randomly throughout the day, or at least note them. Let fewer escape. Each one, no matter how disparate from an arbitrary unifying factor, can become part of the tapestry. Or - alternatively - buy a bottle of vodka, down it all, lie sessile in stupor, and ignore the passing breezes, aleatory or not. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I shall expunge more and more empty conversation from my life, as well. I realise that the concept of &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt; differs depending on whom you ask, and mine may be too strict for many, but since I’ll be lying in a drunken stupor for all of 2011, in any case, these words can be taken with a grain of cesium salt. Or - since my &lt;strong&gt;journaling music&lt;/strong&gt; this morning is &lt;em&gt;Weird Tapes 6&lt;/em&gt; by Hawkwind and the current track happens to be &lt;em&gt;Master of the Universe&lt;/em&gt;, I am reminded that I, in fact, am the master of the universe and therefore, whether I’m lying in a drunken stupor or not, all must heed my idea of &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt; and conform. Those who do not will be consigned to the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I shall expunge more and more empty conversation from my days. Most of what I term &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt; stems from mundane events that happen in the streets, the markets, in lunar orbit or even in the pit. One takes an event and uses it as impetus for a conversation, be it to pick up a chick at a hospoda in Nusle or pass time with a colleague whilst sucking down a bocadillo during a brief lunch between shifts in the ward. Such an impetus doesn’t have to become an &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt;, of course. It can be used as an aleatory idea snatched from the day’s breeze to symbolise something more profound in one’s thoughts, or as a haiku back and forth, or as a metaphor for another concern. What bothers me is that my experience has seen most of these impetuses solely become seed for a flurry of complaints about aspects of &lt;em&gt;the daily grind&lt;/em&gt;. They immediately mire themselves in a negative quicksand, pulling anyone involved into its depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A bloke arrives at hospoda in Nusle after nearly being cut into three pieces by a speeding tramvaj. He begins a conversation with the aforementioned chick. It quickly spirals into a negative morass concerning the inhumanity of tramvaj drivers, the poor state of public transportation, the aimless, destructive arc of government and the heat death of the universe. Now, I don’t want to disparage the heat death of the universe, but the other three topics don’t strike me as constructive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not turn the event into a haiku writing marathon where each three line piece of brilliance details the different decorative configurations of head, torso and abdomen after being severed in three sections by a tramvaj? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not expound on the possible thoughts said driver was having during the lapse? Surely the driver was fantasising of sentient vegetative life in a symmetrical sphere in orbit around our moon, connected telepathically to other symmetrical spheres of sentient vegetative life orbiting the very same moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not just skip to the end and discuss the heat death of the universe at length? Even at such length that one reaches the heat death of the universe! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not just circumvent the whole situation by lying listless at home in a drunken stupor?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obsessive-compulsive Spurts</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
And December progresses. Blather is transcribed directly from neural circuitry to VIM. Tea steeped. I fetched it and imbibed it. All this is part of another morning in Logroño. Mornings in Logroño are, by now, a routine, or each morning routine is chosen from a selection of those I have at hand. The only consistent facet in the selection of routines is the tea. All praise Tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;, which is part of a number of the aforementioned routines, gives me a sensation of accomplishment. Other facets also do, even including Tea, but writing more than any of the rest. The sense of accomplishment fosters peace and this sense of “accomplishment” is the act itself. The content, in the end, doesn’t matter much. I recall the turbulent April of 2000. I was alone in my hotel room in München. Malaise had crept into my days. I felt it tangibly like a film coating my skin. I whipped out the old “Woodnotes” journal (sadly lost forever in the bowels of Aleksandra) and added a few pages to the end. Or perhaps it was in the leather bound journal (a gift from Brynn) that I still have. It is stationed in the bookshelf behind me. Whichever of the two journals it was, writing in it calmed me. That calm emanated from having a sense of purpose. What sense of purpose was that? The writing itself? Sure. It was ethereal, a sensation. The film evaporated from my skin. My chemicals churned differently simply because I placed words on a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I bought the Woodnotes journal at a bookstore when I was living in Austin in 1995 or 1996, I &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt;. My memory’s mottled film shows me a few frames of Craig commenting on the journal, so it may have been before that. 1994? Maybe, but I don’t have any recollection of having it during my “outing” with Melanie. So I retract that. It had to be spring of 1996. A year before, I filled a spiral notebook with jabber. In fact, that very spiral notebook is sitting to the right of my keyboard. I need to finish transcribing it. Those were the days of the University of Houston in Clear Lake and of Marcie. Poor Marcie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, simply having these journals calmed my mind and writing in them, even more, including if the result of said writing was nothing to, er, write home about. I believe it was a form of meditation. I gave up on “real” meditation after a bout with it during the spiral notebook spring. So I was left with writing. And although I am not really a victim of anxiety in general, I think that at least the beginnings of that demonic sensation creep up on me when I &lt;strong&gt;haven’t&lt;/strong&gt; written in a while. Just another reason to keep stream-of-conciousness writing frequent in the morning routine. Words are moderators of the hara and diffusers of the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And believe me, spirits need to be diffuse. Density is not a pretty personality trait, especially for a spirit. Dense spirits tend to pile at the bottom of the cosmic cistern. They become clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Messages from Kris on Mastodon yesterday detailed the difference between approaches in Flavigula music and Youstuva music. The latter is a fusionish project he’s been working with for longer than I’ve known him. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
When working on your material, it is very Melodically/Harmonically complex compared to playing bass with Youstuva. For my parts, Youstuva tends to be more focused on rhythm. (Time signature changes/polymeters/polyrhythms.) Not that your material doesn’t have those aspects as well but it’s a different take on the same aspects for both. (If that makes sense.) That’s one of the reason I love doing multiple projects.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He’s a very versatile player as the two projects are sonically incredibly different. I suppose one could say they are both vaguely steeped in a Jazz / Progressive Rock soup, Youstuva much more than Flavigula, but that’s where the similarity ends. That reminds me that I should listen to Youstuva today. It’s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been exchanging email with Kris concerning &lt;em&gt;Nolju Tafiz&lt;/em&gt; (The Second Instant), formerly titled &lt;em&gt;Sas Tafiz&lt;/em&gt; (The Second Breath - though the meaning was originally the same, the word &lt;em&gt;sas&lt;/em&gt; experienced semantic drift). In my notes that I’m referring to as I type this, I state that the “album” is mostly done. That is untrue. The album (which will end with &lt;em&gt;Nolju Tafiz&lt;/em&gt;) is very far from done, even in the composing department. At the time, I thought I’d just cobble together the tracks I had as demos and titled collectively &lt;em&gt;A Cupboard of Moors&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bricked-up Cupboard&lt;/em&gt;, revise them slightly and have a coherent musical statement. Instead, the revising has become a meticulous recomposing process. It’s marvellously enjoyable. You should try it. It will bring diffusion to your clunky spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nolju Tafiz&lt;/em&gt; and another piece bookend the pieces I am revamping, congealing them into a type of suite. These bookends will feature Christian’s vocals, if he ever gets around to it. Otherwise, they’ll feature extended kalimba solos that are unrelated to the rest of the musical content. I suspect Christian’s “tardiness” in his Flavigula tasks is a combination of slight loss of interest (after all, Flavigula is no longer a fresh concept) and a life in South Carolina that is littered with family commitments, lettuce preparation / cultivation, house remodelling, hag and escort impregnation, and spending hours every morning and evening watching Youtube. His desire and effort to learn FL Studio (or any DAW at all) is impressive, though. The tenuous void around space-time quivers with the harmonic content he eructs from such experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There Is No Discussion Of Geese In This Entry</title>

Of course, the tea has steeped and has been ready for consumption for some minutes now. To be completely honest, I’ve already consumed two cups. In contrast to yesterday (or yesteryear, for those of you in the throes of severe time dilation from marijuana or other assorted psychedelics), I’ll be drinking &lt;em&gt;English Breakfast&lt;/em&gt; today. It’s wondrous bitter tinge overtakes whichever metaphorical warmth I’m feeling at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my musings from over a month ago now, which were meant as the raw material for the blog entries that now sit lacklustre in MongoDb, waiting to be served on either a Gemini or Http platter, I continued my thread of thought concerning concentration. I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The theme for the past week has been thought dispersion. I’m having problems concentrating even now. Possibly, this is because I just looked at the word count of this thurk and found it was ~100 shy of my daily goal. This, in itself, is rather unproductive. Instead of being in the writing, my mind is looking at the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the session, to whatever comes next. Living in this moment becomes harder when the mind goes into a holistic jaunt concerning the hours or whole day surrounding the moment. The moment is a &lt;strong&gt;pinpoint&lt;/strong&gt;, or, as we say in Lakife, &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt; that is immeasurable in its tininess. It moves along the plane of time. I inhabit that tininess, but my mind wants to float above and contemplate the whole plane. There are advantages to both ways of thought, but during a writing session, &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt; is where I want to be. &lt;em&gt;Et mitin af tyk nis&lt;/em&gt;. I want to be inside the point, the dot, the atom. It is the point of the blade that etches. The mind that controls that blade has sensory apparatus uniquely at that point and nowhere else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m listening to an ostensible improvisation by Jayrope’s &lt;em&gt;Air Cushion Finish&lt;/em&gt; project. If you’ve ever heard anything by this project, you’d know that it distracts the concentrated mind. It, itself, demands concentration. Thus, I’m doing the exact opposite at this moment that my previous goal stated. I’m dividing my attention. Perhaps in this &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt;, I’m resigned to that fate. And during this subsequent &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt;, as well. &lt;em&gt;Nolju&lt;/em&gt; is instant. Though another term might do, as well - &lt;em&gt;tyk noliz&lt;/em&gt;. An atom, or seed, or singularity of time. Same idea, though different metaphor. As the book I’m currently reading constantly states - we are the metaphors we inhabit. That again reminds me of Vonnegut, though he’s not the author I’m currently reading, and also passes my mind back to an entry from a few days ago when I also mentioned Vonnegut. Ah, but my concentration drifts. Or am I riding the blade on a stream of conciousness wave? Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I drift now back to my notes from early November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had just published &lt;em&gt;Songs for Looptober&lt;/em&gt; (nine minutes before, according to said notes) and had begun listening to it, as I’m wont to do immediately after a publication. It begins with Christian claiming &lt;em&gt;That’s because you’re a bad person, vole.&lt;/em&gt; Whether this is true or not is up for debate and has been for decades, centuries even. I’ll quote the rest. (Note - I was listening to &lt;em&gt;Pôle&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Besombes &amp; Rizet&lt;/em&gt; immediately before putting on the Flavigula album.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The first thing that strikes me is the loss of a bit of volume switching from &lt;em&gt;Besombes &amp; Rizet&lt;/em&gt; to the new Flavigula. Over the last few days, I’ve remastered the tracks, trying to let the max volumes hover between -11 and -12 LUFS. Possibly this is not enough. I want the compositions to breathe, however, having dynamics. The key may be not to just jam up the limiter, but carefully adjust each of the tracks’ volume to stay below a peak of -6db (headroom, ya know?), but to interact organically. All this before the limiter. I’m still an infant when it comes to the mixing and mastering process, I feel. And infants are only good for one thing - to be eaten. As Acy once said: &lt;em&gt;Babies are high in protein&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve since ended the mastering process by using ffmpeg (and its associated &lt;em&gt;loudnorm&lt;/em&gt;) to normalise the track to -16 LUFS and somewhere between 12 and 16 LRA (loudness range) depending on the dynamics of the piece. This strategy has proven successful so far, or at least no one has made any comments regarding my mastering, though I wish they would, positive or negative. What are music communities for, if not that? Eh? On the piece recently (two days ago) finished for Quentin for today’s TwitchTV stream, I also wanted to add a touch of convolution reverb. Adding it before the normalisation process, however, resulted in muddiness. The muddiness was slight - a mere smear of filth on a thin, plastic plate, perhaps - but enough to make me remove the reverb. Adding the impulse response after normalization would be ideal, but the process’d be too convoluted (pun intended). Or, alternatively, my lethargy may defeat the process before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I’m on the subject of sound design, I’ll blather a bit on the subject of Supercollider. My relationship with the system is tremulous. One grey, protruding half of my personality loves programming and programming for sound design seems &lt;strong&gt;ideal&lt;/strong&gt;. The other grey, protruding half sees it as a mostly grueling routine that sucks away much more time than I’d like for it to. This complaint centers around the “programming” / “practising music” dichotomy. It’s a dichotomy that only exists, obviously, in my mind. Even wiring together patches on SBUP is a type of programming. All of this takes away from time I have my Telecaster cradled in my lap. So, in this querulous module of my mind, “programming for sound design” is lumped in with “programming in general”. The disillusionment arrives when something I bash out in Supercollider doesn’t sound remotely like what I had in my head. Usually this doesn’t bother me when I’m experimenting on “real” instruments, but with, for example, Supercollider, it’s &lt;strong&gt;programming&lt;/strong&gt;. The machine should do as I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I realise that I must simply learn to speak the language better. Bastard machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other news, my restlessness is piquing. I haven’t had the chance to have a “vacation” or trip to Praha since September. Am I stir crazy? No - I just need to feel that for some time there is NO ONE I need to answer to for anything. This is a difficult state to achieve when you live with someone. Someones are demanding. I am destined to live alone again. It’ll come sooner than I think. In fact, the knife’s edge of time, carried on an accelerating wave, speeds towards that very moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Translucent Backdroop of the Age</title>

I recently realised that I didn’t have a copy of Peter Hammill’s &lt;em&gt;X My Heart&lt;/em&gt;. I quickly remedied the atrocity and then listened to said album. I find it glorious. It was released around 1998, around a time of great change for me. The song &lt;em&gt;A Better Time&lt;/em&gt; was on some compilation or other that I was listening to in those days. Such compilations were one way to discover new music, just as hanging out on Mastodon is today, though slightly less dynamic. The “gap” in my psyche that not having this album produced brought about a sentimentality I didn’t know I had for those days. That’d be the “pre-leaving-Brynn” period, of course, not the “I escaped from a hellish marriage then spent a month doing insane things with Mr Bender then found myself in a huge, empty flat in Praha” period. In any case, the “gap” in my cerebral draining pit that not having this album produced spawned a sentimentality I didn’t know I had for those days. That sentimentality was short lived, though, as the last time I clearly remembered listening to the actual CD was either in the Petra Rezka flat, most of the furniture gone, one of my last days there. Or, alternatively, a few months later in Jeníček’s flat during my visit over Xmas 2000. That CD might have ended up with Aleksandra and is therefore lost forever. Bastard me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the notes I am revising for this blog entry, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Today, the third Noisevember cut begins. The starting point are the four tones - Ab G E C#. I will implement a crude granular synthesis of my guitar playing these tones in various octaves. I still consider myself a Supercollider amateur, but I know enough to cut up samples into buffers and then play the buffers in sequence with gaps between them. This should create granular note after granular note. Perhaps I should have them actually played in random order, or in fact, harmonized in random order. A linear counter point of two. I like this idea. I’ll go with it as the backdroop. The BACKDROOP. The thing that hangs in the grey landscape behind all things. The backdroop. The prominence that is not prominent but always there. The hunk of flesh lolling from the sky. The uvula of deities. Fuck um. The tea must be steeped by now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tea is indeed steeped by now. I shall fetch a mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am now listening to the resultant track, &lt;em&gt;Tyk Jena Tin Nulu&lt;/em&gt; (Solitary Seed in the Void) in all its mixed and mastered glory. It’s very sparse, as I set out for it to be, and the four notes are respected, for the most part. They are distributed throughout the track in spurts by guitar, ukulele, Boris (the Korg Minilogue), etc. A C# drone ebbs in the backdroop, ever-present. Perhaps, in honour of this particular backdroop, I should have &lt;em&gt;C#&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt; tattooed on my uvula. It’s not like I’m using my uvula for anything else. It might as well become a decorative object. In any case (the connective of the day), I am now listening to the resultant track, &lt;em&gt;Tyk Jena Tin Nulu&lt;/em&gt;, for the second time. Even after scarcely more than a month, I wouldn’t know the granules are necessarily sampled electric guitar. Happily, I did not insist they continued throughout the whole piece, but only ebbed in and out of silence when they were “necessary”. Apart from the backdroop, nothing walks the sonic landscape constantly. Ideas hop from discrete point to discrete point. To me, the resultant mood is successful precisely because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think during my epoch of daily improvisation, I did not realise that parts that ebb in and out of a landscape create a better overall sonic painting. They serve better than broad, constant strokes of the guitar or synth brush. When sparsity did take priority over creating layers, it was accidental. I hope I’ve learned my lesson. Perhaps this is a factor that contributes to my idea that most “solos” in music are failures. Usually, the soloist wants to paint a bright stroke over a canvas that calls complete attention to itself when the narcissist asshole would better serve the piece with a middle ground between said swath and a type of discrete pointillism. Of course, soloists and improvisers alike tend to get lost in a moment, forgetting their environment. They will be consigned to the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Returning to the nostalgia of 1998, or, in this case, 1997, the music I chose for today’s writing adventure was the first album by Lard Free. Its first track, &lt;em&gt;Warinobaril&lt;/em&gt;, was also on a compilation I was listening to during the initial months of the failed, hellish marriage. That compilation, titled &lt;em&gt;Supernatural Fairy Tales&lt;/em&gt;, provided impetus to explore quite a bit of music unknown to me at the time. With Lard Free, I’m sitting on the floor of our basement apartment on Dexter Avenue (I believe that was the name of the street) in Capitol Hill in Seattle, drinking in this music. I didn’t hear the entire album that contains &lt;em&gt;Warinobaril&lt;/em&gt; until years later, living in Praha, lost in my decade of personal haze.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Connectives Are for the Weak</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/493.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/493.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I have lost the thread. I am certainly out of practise, writing-wise. This is true even if I’ve been more or less consistent over the last month and a half. Or so I tell myself! I sit down and I find myself in a state of pause more than in any other state. The flying fingers of yesteryear are but nostalgia! Oh, woe! Fuck um. Similarly, my fingers stumble after being away in Praha for a week and I begin fumbling at the guitar again. Most past routines, once abandoned, reassemble themselves, perhaps not in the “ideal” form, but in some form or another. One moment, connectives do not exist. Sentences plod shambling one after another. Then, glue arrives from linguistic wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connectives is a topic that “frightens” me in every language. They are the easiest to use clunkily. They are the easiest to use ephemerally. Or, rather, it’s easy to fall back on them when searching for a “proper” construction in which to place one’s thoughts. I see this phenomenon especially with people who only study a language up to a certain point, then proceed to “wing it” during the rest of their shambling, disconnected lives. I’ve been in those shoes from time to time. Certainly, it’s better to be cognizant of one’s linguistic constructions even if you are a native speaker. It allows one to avoid to falling into the “empty words” pit. It’s like… I mean… yeah… you know. Pravě. Peasants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connectives is a topic that “frightens” me in every language. And, to illustrate my fright, I haven’t explored the topic much in Lakife. I’m in the process, but it’s a slog. Subordinate clauses also fall within the realm of linguistic horrors. I realised last night whilst naming the new Flavigula piece that the use of a subordinate clause, required in this case, is ambiguous (and possibly ill-conceived). I’ll elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hapa fela liz li min nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; == The fire of creeping (or crawling) joy. Whereas in English, one can simply qualify &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;creeping&lt;/em&gt;, Lakife’s current grammar insists on a subordinate clause. The main clause &lt;em&gt;hapa fela liz&lt;/em&gt; is simply “fire joy GENITIVE-PARTICLE” and could also be stated &lt;em&gt;joy’s fire&lt;/em&gt;. A subordinate clause that modifies the closest noun phrase starts with &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;li nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; (which means “THAT along-the-ground moving”) could refer to &lt;em&gt;hapa&lt;/em&gt; (fire) or to &lt;em&gt;fela&lt;/em&gt; (joy). I invented a new connective particle - &lt;em&gt;limin&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;li min&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps - that indicates that the subject of the subordinate clause is the closest genitive. So, &lt;em&gt;hapa fela liz li min nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; would be, literally, (the) fire of joy that (the) joy creeps. I like it, and it reminds me a bit of Toki Pona structurally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the phrase &lt;em&gt;li nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; is used enough, it could reasonably be compressed into a single adjective. It happens as languages evolve, and if you don’t believe me, you can consult Lyle Campbell’s &lt;em&gt;Historical Linguistics&lt;/em&gt;. You have it over there on your nightstand. It’s not just decoration. Read it. So, compression - reasonably, &lt;em&gt;li nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; could be compressed to &lt;em&gt;nutzenja&lt;/em&gt;, which would simply be “activity along the ground”. Hrm. I like that. This would simplify the title, as well - &lt;em&gt;hapa fela liz nutzenja&lt;/em&gt;. If you wanted to make the fire creep along the ground, instead, you’d state &lt;em&gt;hapa nutzenja fela liz&lt;/em&gt;. Joy’s creeping fire. Now that I consider it, I like that title better. Funny how pondering something moulds it. Bastard brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Voy a retroceder un poco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connectives is a topic that “frightens” me in every language. It’s one that I have mastered in no language - not even in my native language. I purposely leave out connectives. My sentences rest on their own. The flow is implied. Chords connecting phrases are only in the mind of the reader. The style reminds me of Vonnegut, vaguely. It also reminds me of how I sometimes write music, and of some music that I immensely enjoy. I create a patchwork of modal colours, sewn together. The thread binding them place them side by side, and the thread’s colour is itself vague, an unclear indigo grey. Traditional harmonic movement is usually not part of my agenda. Like traditional harmonic movement, it’s important for me that the thread, no matter how vaguely hued, &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; exist. The connective tissue can be a single phrase, even a single note, or lack of phrase, or even lack of a single note - something implied. However, I do find myself pondering vi bII i cadences frequently. Ah ha! My assholery has been revealed. I used a connective two sentences ago! I should be tortured for my lack of consistency. The weed that is my core neural binding should be ripped from its metaphorical earth. That reminds me that I wanted to explore tertiary dominants, or a similar concept not using necessarily dominants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coffee Cups Made From The Skulls Of Marketing Men</title>

Speaking of James -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, that is an odd way to start a blog entry, isn’t it? &lt;em&gt;Speaking of James -&lt;/em&gt; has no context. Actually, considering that I do look back over old entries from time to time, given my writing history, it’s not a very odd way to start a blog entry at all. So, I’ll begin again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of James - and possibly drifting into &lt;em&gt;quejica&lt;/em&gt; mode - he is wandering more and more often into the sea of marketing. I do understand why, naturally, and don’t necessarily blame him, though that doesn’t mean I won’t make a coffee cup or tea mug or other receptacle from his cranium. He’s spent the last two years involved more with getting &lt;em&gt;what we do&lt;/em&gt; out and into the eyes of prospective clientele. This is in contrast to doing development, which is my principal role. He is wandering more and more often into the undulating waters of marketing, submerged in a mentality that I’ve been trying to escape since before my birth. For example, he frequently asks for architectural changes that he declares must be &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;. He has lost perspective on the time it takes to morph and debug code. The marketing mentality is a curse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I pine for simple days when I sat around plunking in programs that burped forth absurdities to entertain myself and my friends. Those days are mostly gone. But there is Gemini. Gemini is good. Perhaps I’ll see a resurgence of the spirit of those simple days. Perhaps I’ve already seen its beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking no longer of James -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some dude that I met at RIO last year plucks away at an acoustic guitar or some other such acoustic instrument. The results flow from my near-field monitors and buffet against my tympani. The music has a quaint British folk quality that used to entice me but now does almost nothing for me. Renata, the spirits of the netherworld take her soul, still follows a similar path. Perhaps my tastes in music are narrowing. Is it a factor of decrepitude? Surely, it is a factor of other narrowings I’ve consciously performed in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve made it a point to &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to cut out parts of my life that I find distract too much from the &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; tasks. What are the important tasks, the mustelid in the corner asks? Well, making music, for one. I’m pretty satisfied with my results concerning that. In fact, I probably spend more time on practising and / or composing or recording music than anything else summed. Writing is another &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; task, though I’ve only recently taken it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sensory dispersal of common life takes its toll on me no matter my narrowing goals. As much as I try to ignore it, I’m also a “victim” of social media idleness. I’ve eliminated most everything except for Mastodon, but I still take a look at Facebook occasionally because there are still stubborn souls there who REFUSE to migrate to anywhere else. I pity them. Perhaps I should make coffee cups or tea mugs from their skulls. That way, I could abandon Facebook altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to think that megalomaniacal entity could be useful for “marketing” Flavigula music, in the sense that more people could know about it by some sort of promotional (marketing) magic. I initially considered it a test. Now I consider the test done. Though there are various ambient and electronic groups on said megalomaniacal entity that I’ll comment to when Flavigula has a new release, I’m done with megalomaniacal magic marketing systems. I’ve seen no noticeable results. Word of mouth, Mastodon, flavigula.net and thurk.org gemini suffice. Oh, and Submarine Broadcasting when and if I submit future “main sequence” albums to them. They can market um up if they wish. I consider that part out of my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyhow, again, the sensory dispersal of common life takes its toll on me no matter my narrowing goals. I’m not exactly angered, as I don’t commonly experience that emotion, but frustrated. Or perhaps the emotion is a gradient flowing between frustration and resignation. Part of it comes from being in a relationship and having to spend time every evening watching television with Marisa. Not everything we watch is drivel, and some films / series that we choose pique my imagination, but for the most part it’s a waste of my time. For her, it’s mindless downtime after dealing with children all day at work and dealing with stress-oozing family matters via telephone at home. And I understand the need for this. However, consequently, she usually doesn’t want to watch something intellectually stimulating. Over the months, there have been trends of shows concerning lawyers, political uprising, getting one’s head bashed in with a lead pipe, herds of goats lecturing on script writing for the masses, and the fertility of Spanish ogres. With all that in mind, my opinion is that movies, shows, books and tales about trials, courtrooms and the social lives of lawyers and lawyer types can marinate in a tub of feces. I dig a good detective flick, though. Those are different beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mélange</title>

Today is the first day in a few epochs that I’ve awoke without a headache, however slight. My final conclusion is carbohydrate intake within a certain number hours before going to sleep and slowing my metabolism. My main crime is eating something in bed before retiring. Pistachios are culpable. They will be banished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday’s experiment, which I shall repeat today, that resulted in a morning without a dull, cerebral ache, involved having NOTHING to eat at all after approximately 15.40 except for the lassi I made in the evening. Strangely, the lassi included honey and I was not affected. This leads me to believe that sugar itself is not a culprit. Further tests are needed. And the lassi was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m in the throes of mixing and mastering the new Noisevember album. Unlike last year’s adventure, I consider this year’s musical journey a substantial album. It jerks. It burbles. It trickles. It undulates. I think the pieces are worthy of something other than naming it just another month-long sonic experiment. I’m leaving the final title up to a narcissist asshole, however, so it’s possible I’ll be punished for the sheer fondness I have of my musical adventure’s results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original concept was to attempt to complete a piece within every two days. Since the result came to 15 tracks, I’d say I was successful here. The second concept, one that I only followed for the first third or so of the month, was that each “miniature” was based on a series of between three and five notes randomly chosen by a Bash script I wrote whilst sitting in the passenger’s seat of Marisa’s car on the way back from our small getaway to Agoncillo. Agoncillo is a small, frightening village in the deserty mini-mountains of south-east La Rioja. You are not required to visit. In fact, you are prohibited from visiting. The coffee is awful and there is not a single mustelid in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyhow, the original concept was to write “miniatures” based on a series of between three and five notes randomly chosen by a Bash script. I subconsciously abandoned that idea after running through the groups of notes I’d generated during the aforementioned journey. To me, there is a stark harmonic contrast between the pieces that began as such and the later ones, composed from whatever my hara eructed at inception. I’ve shuffled the playlist a bit, so anyone trying to discern which track started with which compositional method could be flummoxed and in their flummoxed state find me and bludgeon me with a small length of lead pipe. I won’t blame them. In fact, the bludgeoning(s) can serve as inspiration for further experimental material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After starting the first piece, epochs or a month ago, I wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
I began the first piece yesterday. It starts with a bang - a bang from the dust from the Plaits, crumbling quickly into particle matter. I will create minimal drones that interact harmonically and spatially over a few minutes. They will act more as a backdrop than anything else. Spooky resonances will bubble! Moderate or even sparse “melodies” will pepper the drones! The aforementioned notes will form these melodies. Will they be true “melodies”? Of course. Even two notes repeated endlessly is a melody.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The only concern I have is the new VCO I have. I abandoned the 2hp VCO for this Złob dual VCO which is so far not satisfactory. It just doesn’t play well with my filters. Of course, before abandoning it, I shall put it through the rigors of being a part of Shambal Brambel’s Undulating Platypus. Or was it “ululating”? Only the deity that sits sessile on a (mostly) abandoned moon circling an anonymous gas giant in an unnamed solar system would be able to say. Let’s ask him. Let’s not wait for a response.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Herr Złob VCO has received much use, in fact. I’ve had success modulating one of the oscillators with the other. Well, not directly, because that’s not possible, but by tossing the signal into the WMD/SSF MMF and having the other oscillator modulate the cutoff frequency. The resulting frequency modulation can be used for delightful percussion sounds and nefarious drones. Also, its triangle wave does great LPG bongos. Herr Złob VCO will remain in my toolbox for an epoch or two.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let It Reign</title>

I have an empty cup that used to contain tea sitting before me. It was Earl Grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The confusion before the word / preposition &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; is astounding. Before it irks me further, I’ll expound, as it was fucking with my development of &lt;em&gt;Lakife&lt;/em&gt;. In English, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; can mean temporally in the immediate past of whatever temporal theme is being discussed. It can also mean &lt;em&gt;spatially&lt;/em&gt; immediately to the front. This ambiguity is not amusing to me. It is an abomination. My solution for Lakife is to clarify the difference for myself and for the table of pre- post- positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Originally, the table had the &lt;em&gt;spatial before&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;temporal before&lt;/em&gt; in the same row, associated with the preposition &lt;em&gt;tin&lt;/em&gt;. When I first began the design of the language, much of the work was done on 20+ hour bus rides around the southwest part of Australia. Possibly I was hungover during part of that time. Excuses aside, Lakife’s &lt;em&gt;fur&lt;/em&gt;  signifies &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt;, in the literal aspect. Spatially, the English equivalent is &lt;strong&gt;behind&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fur … pot&lt;/em&gt; is the temporal version and &lt;em&gt;fur … nis&lt;/em&gt; is the spacial version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Etjo tex anja liz fur noz sopen pot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will eat her child before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since &lt;em&gt;noz sopen&lt;/em&gt; (nightfall) already indicates time, the &lt;em&gt;pot&lt;/em&gt; at the end there is optional. I suppose &lt;em&gt;behind nightfall&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;towards the back of nightfall&lt;/em&gt; could be useful metaphoric or poetic concepts, but I’m sure you get what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Solan qotzifur neimolja tel topen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They went towards the back of the boat. Nothing surrealistic in this one. I apologize if you were expecting otherwise. On the other trembling paw, expectations are poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Topen&lt;/em&gt; possibly is not required, either, since movement is obvious by verbalizing &lt;em&gt;fur&lt;/em&gt; (with &lt;em&gt;qotzi&lt;/em&gt;, which indicates past tense, perfect aspect, vole).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Similarly, &lt;em&gt;potom&lt;/em&gt;, just like in Czech, indicates something that comes after something else temporally. In Lakife, it also indicates &lt;strong&gt;to the front&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;in the front&lt;/strong&gt; spatially. I’m sure that toots the muffin of the universe. As it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ambiguity in language is useful for poetry and quirky prose. It’s also useful for one of my most hated things - puns. Though I’m trying to create grammar that is very delineated in Lakife, quirks of vocabulary and derivation will surely make ambiguity reign. Ambiguity should reign. Let our queen by Sweet Entropy. She is an androgynous “queen”. We’ll simply use the pronoun &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; to refer to her / it, as it has no gender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve always been of the opinion that gender in language enforces gender roles and stereotypes in a culture. The machismo of Spain and the festering bowels of Latin America seems to support my view. I’m aware that linguistic gender possibly arose from actual roles that men and women played in society back in what a narcissist asshole would call &lt;em&gt;the good ol days&lt;/em&gt;. Since I am unflinchingly progressive, I say &lt;strong&gt;fuck um&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;em&gt;the good ol days&lt;/em&gt; and so-called natural roles of anyone. Let’s shatter traditions, habits and long standing prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like Estonian, Lakife doesn’t really have gender. Certainly, there are no gender markers on nouns nor adjectives. Add &lt;em&gt;-ju&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-ja&lt;/em&gt; to the pronoun &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; to create “he” or “she” respectively, for convenience. However, those suffixes have very different meanings in other contexts, which is another break from gender roles. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt; (and sometimes &lt;em&gt;-ja&lt;/em&gt;) shows an active state of an idea or entity whilst &lt;em&gt;-u&lt;/em&gt; (and sometimes &lt;em&gt;-ju&lt;/em&gt;) indicates a passive or resting state. These are not my personal commentaries on the roles of female and male. No. It just happened as such, as sometimes the development of Lakife feels out of my hands. I set many rules in place and continue to do so, and given those rules as, um, let’s say &lt;strong&gt;axioms&lt;/strong&gt;, the whole system grows. It is, in a sense, generative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oblivious Rule the Earth</title>

    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/489.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
What I have come to think of as the &lt;em&gt;oblivious nature of the Spanish&lt;/em&gt; or simply the &lt;em&gt;Spanish behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, just occurred outside my apartment, in the stub of a corridor, in front and partially inside of the lift. That last bit is very important. Our new neighbour, whose name is Juanco or somesuch, stood in the stub of the corridor speaking to another human who stood partially in and partially out of the lift. This latter human was therefore blocking the lift and preventing anyone else in the building from using it. The conversation carried on for at least ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since living in Logroño, I’ve noticed this type of behaviour in locals in general, and especially when it comes to the less than elegant process of saying “goodbye” to someone or a group of someones. An impromptu congregation manifests and seals itself inside a bubble. This frighteningly localised bubble does not admit any stimuli from beyond its membrane. A tendency also exists, when in a more public place, for this bubble to block or divert any pedestrian traffic in its proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m aware that this behaviour exists in places other than Spain, but its existence has announced itself much more strongly in this country than in any other in which I’ve lived. I’m also aware that in my decrepitude I may becoming more easily irked by the ways of the masses. Enough of caveats, though. These actions are empty of empathy, show a lack of observation skills, and promote general bubble-thinking. My rage only intensifies when these denizens put on the mask of joy or drink and the excuse of &lt;em&gt;fiesta&lt;/em&gt; to excuse themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They need to die.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Suspended Ambiguity May Get Over Itself Now</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/488.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/488.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of Michael Achenbach, I should attempt to look him up. My first question to him will be &lt;em&gt;Did you ever get around to making your own music?&lt;/em&gt; He was the &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; type, musically, though he studied to be a mechanical or electrical or some other sort of engineer. He’d pick up a stringed instrument and it just made sense to him. Though, admittedly, I did hear him spending long hours practising in his disheveled hovel-room in the Enfield house. &lt;em&gt;Intuitive&lt;/em&gt; contrasts with &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;, one who struggles with every phrase. Or, I could say that I am musically intuitive but not mechanically intuitive. I’m certainly intuitive with abstractions, and music appears in my mind as an abstract force. The truth sits somewhere in the vague middle, as always. Fucking axis thinking. Fuck you, Brian Eno. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Music is a process borne on wings of intellect but accelerated by emotive force - and the resultant vector is what I call the &lt;strong&gt;hara&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finished the mixing and mastering of the tenth Noisevember this morning. A disappointment that runs in tandem with these “compositional” challenges is that it seems that the participants are more concerned with timbre and sonic variety than harmonic studies. This goes for the narcissist asshole who is my “partner” in diabolic deeds, as well. So, what happened to interest in harmonic diversity, or should I not be surprised in this case since the “challenge” is entitled &lt;em&gt;Noisevember&lt;/em&gt;? Whether I’m surprised or not, I muse once again: &lt;em&gt;What happened to interest in harmonic diversity&lt;/em&gt;? What I hear is incredibly creative in the timbral universe, and I do admit that timbral composition can be amazing. What I also hear is the recycling of suspended chord patterns and minor drones in the harmonic sphere. Melody, when even apparent in this realm of music, waddles along the same cadence paths as usual since baroque times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems harmonic complexity reached an apex mid-20th century, plateaued and then fell into a gradual decrescendo. Pockets of creativity still exist. Hey, there’s Flavigula, for example! And I am always drawn towards those pockets and they exert powerful influence over my creativity. Run of the mill suspended chord patterns need to DIE. Or at least I really don’t need to hear them dribbling from every “experimentalist”‘s corner shop.&lt;/p&gt;

A stalk of bamboo hovers over me in eternal vigil. Eternity is the span of its existence, of course. Isn’t &lt;em&gt;eternity&lt;/em&gt; the span of any &lt;em&gt;entity’s&lt;/em&gt; existence? Does it take eternity to pass from the burp from the womb into the sudden state of decomposition? Does it take an eternity to pass from a smooth seed cradled in sod into the sudden state of decomposition? The span of life, this &lt;em&gt;eternity&lt;/em&gt;, passes in a flash. Every detail of its presence evaporates. He / she / it who perceived the passage no longer exists. So why my moaning about paying attention to each nuance in the wrinkles that form my day? When my conciousness decomposes or passes on or finally gets to hang out in that vast, yawning gulf between the walls of the edifice in which I live, surely my memories will pass with it. But even when I’m living in my mini-yurt in Mongolia and the only thing of note I do is play cribbage with Jeremy every few days, I’ll be able to pour through the collected details of my life and thus be in a state of evolution. Life itself is a composition. And compositions should always refer back to themselves. Otherwise, they are just a string of loosely connected riffs, themes, melodies and syncopations. Whether or not someone gets to experience the composition that is my life secondhand doesn’t matter. Fuck um. It’s the composing itself that toots my muffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following that thread, at times I do muse about death. It’s a comfort. Upon this passage, I will no longer be dragged behind the will to be creative, or the will to do anything, really. A relief! A breath! There will not be competition, cooperation, absurd ambition or anything at all. When death comes, I’ll have time to sit around and listen to and read all this &lt;em&gt;hovno&lt;/em&gt; I’ve stirred up from the mud of my lower mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also speaking of death, I continue to take &lt;strong&gt;freezing&lt;/strong&gt; showers to spur my telomeres into action! I will live forever! Actually, I’ve come to like the &lt;strong&gt;freezing&lt;/strong&gt; showers. They awaken not only my telomeres, but send me fresh into my studio to dream up more noise, be it sonic or typewritten. From time to time, I also do work that relates to mine and James’s project, but don’t tell the Dean of Creative Science that. He’d have me flayed and tossed into the vat of kumquat juice he keeps handy in the smaller interdimensional place in the middle left-hand drawer of his oaken desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, yes, I will live forever! I &lt;strong&gt;cry&lt;/strong&gt; so like I am 16 again, or even 17. Immortality is only ever a very introverted goal. For narcissist assholes, this statement may seem counter-intuitive. They want &lt;strong&gt;LEGACIES&lt;/strong&gt;, after all. They think that a &lt;strong&gt;LEGACY&lt;/strong&gt; will buy them immortality. Bah! Immortality is an internal state that allows one to wander among the crevices of everyday invention. It is the passing of the dust motes and etchings on the walls of those crevices from short-term to long-term memory. It is a personal quest. It is life seen from within. Immortality is in the domain of the living, not the dead. &lt;strong&gt;LEGACIES&lt;/strong&gt;! Bah!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waffles for Tea Leaves</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The tea is made. It steams beside my telephone and painted fish. My palate and stomach awaits a plate of waffles I just concocted. Yes, on weekends, I abandon my “diet”. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does routine really unhinge time so it passes like a flutter in a 12 year old hag’s loins? It depends whether it is an ingrained routine or a “conscious” routine. And I think that even the former can be converted into the latter if one denies the &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt; module of the brain dominance during said routine. The &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt; module is responsible for daydreaming. Or, rather, it is responsible for the inception of daydreaming. Other modules take over, focusing a daydream, an illusion, a distraction from the details of the moment. Yes, habitual routines can be &lt;strong&gt;boring&lt;/strong&gt; routines, but, as I discussed a few entries ago, concentrating on details of even scrubbing the filth from a fork or reorganizing the pinwheel collection one keeps in the vast, yawning, interdimensional gulf between the walls of the edifice you live in can become a &lt;em&gt;zen&lt;/em&gt; experience. The focus trains the mind to recognize true insight when it noses out of the &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Letting the &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt; play constantly, and thus letting a succession of daydreams be the dominant mental state during ingrained routines, diminishes chances that one will recognize any unique insight in the random deluge of debris vomited by what I have come to call the &lt;em&gt;accursed module&lt;/em&gt;. Focus should always be the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This also goes for creative routines, such as writing in one’s electronic dumping ground. I consider Martenblog an electronic dumping ground. Though some of the ideas that surface are potentially brilliant, it’s really a distillation of another module that is associated with the &lt;em&gt;accursed module&lt;/em&gt;. Most humans would name this module the &lt;em&gt;stream of conciousness&lt;/em&gt; module. So be it. I consider it a narrower version of Herr Accursed. So, the focus argument also goes for creative routines, such as writing in one’s electronic dumping ground. A narcissist asshole might argue that I am already focusing because I am writing, but I refer to the details between the words, the act itself, which is below each syntactic and semantic structure. Since the original topic was remembering the details of everyday life, doesn’t the pressure of my fingers on the keys of my mechanical keyboard count? Don’t the gentle creakings from the void between my walls count? In the end, the product can endure in its electronic, typewritten, tattooed, painted, spewed, broiled titrated or composed form, and furthermore the details of the process itself can pass from short-term to long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chasm Between Short-Term and Long-Term Memory</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/485.gmi</id>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for reminding me that I should be steeping my tea. Today, I drink &lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;, which differs from my &lt;em&gt;rough draft&lt;/em&gt; version of this entry, in which I was drinking &lt;em&gt;Lady Grey&lt;/em&gt;. The contrast is sharp, or, as we say in Lakife, &lt;em&gt;hele kotzom&lt;/em&gt;. Also, I commented in my &lt;em&gt;rough draft&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Lady Grey&lt;/em&gt; is tea for an elitist. In some way or another, I’m certainly an elitist. I also made the comment &lt;em&gt;British bastards&lt;/em&gt; in reference to &lt;em&gt;Lady Grey&lt;/em&gt;. I’m under the impression that all &lt;em&gt;Earl Grey&lt;/em&gt; style teas originate from the seed of Sri Lanka. Or at least their idea did. Therefore, &lt;em&gt;Sri Lankan bastards&lt;/em&gt;. What can I do, though? They are tasty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, is the tea of the common man. In some way or another, I’m certainly a common man. In my universe of one, I’m as common as they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today, I put on &lt;em&gt;Distant Void&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Dr Norah Lorway&lt;/strong&gt;, who evidently lives in Cornwall, a place to my liking. I can see how living there might inspire this music. It’s elliptic, yawning and disturbingly tranquil. In other words, I like it. I chose it after pulling up Bandcamp. Instead of going straight to &lt;em&gt;Puppy Bordiga&lt;/em&gt;‘s page and listening to his &lt;em&gt;Guitar Works&lt;/em&gt;, the feature on &lt;strong&gt;experimental music&lt;/strong&gt; caught my eye and after sampling another that was not to my liking, I settled on &lt;strong&gt;Dr Norah Lorway&lt;/strong&gt;. Yawning. Chasmic. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I caught myself earlier mentally planning what I shall do this morning and in what order. My first reaction was that creating such a routine in my mind for Friday morning was already extracting the morning from my life. My next feeling was that the details of the events I routinize will be lost. Naturally, the remains of the tasks (this writing episode being one of them) will remain to posterity. Well, they will remain in digital form until the heat death of the universe spreads the individual particles that represent them uniformly about the cosmos. That’s plenty of time for me to sit around, imbibe litres of vodka, and contemplate them. The details of the execution will be lost, drizzling trough the crevices of my short-term memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an aside, Christián usually waxes obsequiously at length about the qualities of his &lt;em&gt;dad&lt;/em&gt;. Lately, he’s been praising the old man’s organization skills. The guy does seem meticulous from my plump friend’s descriptions. I’ve known Chris for over 16 years and an adjective I’d rarely associate with him is &lt;em&gt;organized&lt;/em&gt;. So, if he learns something from his father, good for him. Good for both of them. If his malady is anything like my ancient ways then the most difficult first step is seizing the impetus. I’m referring to the impetus to create, of course. Having my studio laid out before me so I can easily put any idea to “tape” is endlessly beneficial. My plump friend needs to get his fecal matter together and set up something similar, even on a tiny scale. Having one’s tools prepared to use at any arbitrary moment is mandatory for the creative spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In relation to that, remind me to stick my handwritten journal in my backpack. Oh, wait. I never go anywhere excepting to &lt;em&gt;Mercadona&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lidl&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the current topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Details were slipping through the crevices in my mental edifice. Indeed. Though I know that the slippage will happen, has happened, is happening because my mental fondue is not capable of digesting multitudinous stimuli. Fucking subconscious filters. So far, I do not know many ways to capture individual details and pass them from short-term to long-term memory. One that does work is to immediately discuss the event with someone who is loitering in the area. That is, make it a more nebulous event. If the mind has further associations, the passage to long-term memory is facilitated. My experience bears this. An example that leaps to mind is a writing episode from 1993. I was sitting at a terminal set up by Craig in the house at Enfield. I typed some pretentious complex paragraph which could be interpreted in myriad manners. I then discussed it with Michael Achenbach, who was loitering in the common room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So - to pass an event more clearly from short-term to long-term memory, not only notice the details of the process, but also discuss (possibly even with yourself) the process or content produced by the process. There is a difference, again, between the &lt;em&gt;produced content&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;, but they are entwined, I’m sure, as far as fixing one or both in long-term memory. My situation with Marisa worries me slightly in this regard. I can’t really talk to her to any depth about my creative endeavours, as they are not her cup of &lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;. I shall continue the plan of writing every morning until I have seven days worth of dribble. Then I’ll compile it, as I’m doing now. From time to time, I must randomly select a Martenblog entry and consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Part of Everyone is a Narcissist Asshole</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/484.gmi</id>

I put on the album &lt;em&gt;Perhaps&lt;/em&gt; by Harold Budd before beginning this moment-dump. I glanced through the review at Samadhi Sound previously. It’s an album of improvisations, like some of Budd’s other work. I appreciate that. Of course, I cannot pay attention to the &lt;strong&gt;details&lt;/strong&gt; whilst writing, but the ambience the sound-universe makes is splendid. I miss multitudinous details whilst attempting to commit the mortal sin upon focus: multitasking. Yes, listening to music during &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;programming&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;shaving the mouse found between the baseboard and the yawning interdimensional space between the walls of this edifice I live in&lt;/strong&gt; is multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve considered cutting out all &lt;em&gt;background activities&lt;/em&gt; during my days to try to focus better. This includes removing all the autonomic functions in my living corpse, resulting in the husk that now sits before the “terminal” typing in elaborations to a stream-of-consciousness moment-dump from last week. You see, I decided, to eke along my dissolving habit of writing, to do these moment-dumps every morning for approximately a week. Afterwards, I take them, as I’m doing now, and reform them into actual entries for the Martenblog. So far, the idea is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve considered cutting out all &lt;em&gt;background activities&lt;/em&gt; during my days to try to focus better. My good buddy and workmate, James, has got it right. When I put on &lt;em&gt;Aranis&lt;/em&gt;, for example, at his place in Praha, he cannot work. He’s not familiar with the music and since it is both rhythmically and harmonically busy, it distracts him. Much like the people I was ranting about in the last entry, James is also a narcissist asshole, but the fact that he spurns listening to &lt;em&gt;Aranis&lt;/em&gt; is not a manifestation of that aspect of his personality. I’m even distracted, somewhat, by the sparse piano tones Budd put to platter as I type. The clustered, rhythmic arpeggios of the current piece ( &lt;em&gt;Moss Landing&lt;/em&gt; ) are distracting because they have melancholic beauty (the best type of beauty, in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast, I’ve noticed that when I’m programming and no music is playing, my mind begins to become numb. I cannot discount habit, however. The mind loves latching on to routines. It may be complaining that I am not following a normal &lt;em&gt;put on some background noise and program&lt;/em&gt; agenda. The lack of background information stupefies the environment. Or the lack of this information, though not analyzed in real time, diminishes my want or ability to function as a programmer, or even as a human, or mustelid, or interdimensional rodent. That being stated, I usually put on instrumental music because music with those pesky vocals is much &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; distracting. A comparison can be made to music that is simply a melody or sparse piano tones without an &lt;strong&gt;apparent&lt;/strong&gt; harmonic backdrop. I enjoy this sort of music in isolation. That is, unlike programming, one of my mental modules does not get frustrated in the backdrop. That frustrated module (in the case of programming) without music begins to shudder and demand that the other mental faculties are taken down. It becomes a narcissist asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Ache to be the Center of the Cosmos</title>

I interrupted myself by answering Christián’s comment concerning his current listening obsessions. This time round, it happens to be Brian Eno. Good for him. Not for Brian, but for Christián. Brian knows nothing of Christián. Actually, this also may be a good thing. So good for both of them. I’m happy that my friend is discovering music that I have been talking about, indeed &lt;em&gt;championing&lt;/em&gt; for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here’s my issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some people have a manner of expressing themselves that rubs my fur incorrectly. Christián’s obsessions and his “excitement” in the moment about them is one example. Even if I’ve championed Eno for decades, when Christián discovers the music &lt;strong&gt;himself&lt;/strong&gt;, it is if he was the founder of the ambient institution and must proselytize it to even me. Perhaps I am taking his “excitement” as the wrong thing, but my impression is a forceful “evangelist” attitude. I’m aware that advocating for Eno is not a bad thing at all, but it is the manner that bothers me. It infuses my friend’s personality in many ways. A long list sits in journals askew on my bookshelves detailing this same phenomenon in others, &lt;strong&gt;and in myself&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This an indicator of narcissism. Because of it, my friend will die horribly plump and alone in a murky house in South Carolina, surrounded by reeking empty cans of Coors Light and dried strips of his own flesh, clawed away during nightmares of being spurned endlessly by nubile chicks. The wasting away, this punishment for egoism, of course, will only happen once all of his tasks for Flavigula are complete. I will discard him like a holed dishrag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I should be lighter on the imbeciles of the world. I recall when Lee (whom I still dream about frequently) discovered &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, it’d been in my playlist since I was 15 (or thereabouts). It annoyed me to no end that he &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; about it. He played it whilst traipsing around in his underwear. He sang it ( &lt;em&gt;The Gunner’s Dream&lt;/em&gt;, I think ) in Acy’s shower during the bizarre summer of 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Possibly I simply have problems with people who are &lt;em&gt;obsessive&lt;/em&gt; and what I see as narcissist outpourings are just a result of the narrow focus they have. What Lee was doing was finding joy in the discovery of something he loved. Or, well, being &lt;strong&gt;obsessed&lt;/strong&gt;. Same thing? Similar? I should give even narcissist assholes their temporary bliss before they either shoot themselves in the head at McDonald Observatory in West Texas or die in filth surrounded by Coors Light cans in South Carolina. After all, I am a fair fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll return after I begin the steeping of TEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A concern I have lately is memory. I’m referring to the actual process of memory. It’s actually not a concern of just lately, but of most of my life. Unfortunately, when I address it, my strategies only work for a few days, maybe a week, perhaps an epoch or two, and then I lapse back into a malaise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Specifically, I’m writing about short-term memory. I have always somewhat had my &lt;em&gt;head in the clouds&lt;/em&gt;. Because of this, I miss details as I wander through my days. I’ve tried so-called &lt;em&gt;mindfulness meditation&lt;/em&gt; many times. Again, I get into it for a few days, maybe a week, perhaps an epoch or two, but then lapse into my normal &lt;em&gt;not practising mindfulness meditation&lt;/em&gt; routine. The &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; strategy, which is not new at all, but devised by one of the mental modules floating around in my mind-soup during the endless journeys to and from the outskirts of Munich during the summer of 2001, is to be &lt;em&gt;meta-mindful&lt;/em&gt;. The process is simple and more reliable than actively trying to sit quietly and pay attention to surroundings. The key is to stamp out daydreaming. This is particularly important during mundane tasks such as washing the dishes, consuming vast quantities of vodka or planning the ascension of the mustelid regime in South Asia. Daydreaming is the assassin of attentive thought. Simply concentrate on the details of each task at hand. The expressive clankings of dishes of plates and glasses and subtle poppings of soap bubbles create a tapestry of sound. The wheezing and choking and burning burbling from your oesophagus are the last music you experience before falling into stupor. The chatter of whiskered muzzles and rustle of fur weave nuances into passing instants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The space between moments is the space where a mouse hides between the baseboard and the cavernous, interdimensional gulf known only to the architects of this building and to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that’s the &lt;em&gt;mindfulness of the moment&lt;/em&gt;. Whilst washing the caked filth off a lasagna dish or equally whilst shaving the aforementioned mouse, I can pay attention to movements of my wrists, the poppings of soap bubbles and / or the scrape of the razor and how they orchestrate to create an atmosphere. I am brought to the idea that I am mostly concerned with sound worlds. &lt;strong&gt;Mainly&lt;/strong&gt; concerned with sound worlds. Since one of my concerns is creating music (in this particular infinity of epochs, anyway), it makes sense. Paying attention to ebb and flow of warmth in my muscles and currents of breeze on my skin could also be suitable &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; opportunities, but, then again, that’d be &lt;em&gt;multitasking&lt;/em&gt;, the enemy of focus. &lt;/p&gt;

If the reach between what we perceive and what actually “is” is as infinite as it seems to me, then our perceptions during waking and our perceptions during dreaming are equally valid. It goes without saying, or writing, or squawking that our perceptions whilst flummoxed on some drug or another is also equally valid. As there are other shambling physical forms in the world, the way we perceive them during moments of wakefulness, dreaming, drugged out bliss or psychotic rage isn’t as important as the way we &lt;em&gt;react&lt;/em&gt; to our perceptions of them during moments of wakefulness, dreaming, drugged out rage or psychotic bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I posit that for the safety of all, each &lt;em&gt;flow of mental information&lt;/em&gt; should be separated from its fleshy container. How this is done is irrelevant. Transfer these &lt;em&gt;flows of mental information&lt;/em&gt; into digital form, giving each a universe created from all experienced whilst in fleshy form, including daydreaming, nightdreaming and drugged out bliss-or-rageful interludes. This way, since no fleshy forms are left, no fleshy form can cause damage to any other fleshy form. Each &lt;em&gt;flow of mental information&lt;/em&gt; flounders or flourishes in a universe of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve always had the premonition that this is similar to what happens anyhow when one’s &lt;em&gt;flow of mental information&lt;/em&gt; is about to cease. The brain constructs a completely new universe in which to live during its &lt;em&gt;final moments&lt;/em&gt;. This universe is basically reincarnation, and time is stretched to the length of a lifetime for the &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; during these moments. The process is, of course, also recursive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, see ya in the next life, brotha.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obsequious Arrogance</title>

Instead of claiming that something is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; of some genre or other category, I need to remember to use &lt;em&gt;my favourite&lt;/em&gt;, instead, not for &lt;strong&gt;political correctness&lt;/strong&gt;, of course, but to tone down all things arrogant inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Boorish when I awake. My nap was useless, of course, since now I feel much worse than I did before. Except for the fatigue, I am the same plus the added symptoms of too much sleep and not enough activity. I am very indisciplined. Solving this hateful aspect of my personality (which amounts to stamping it out) is a giant step on the way to enhancing my 1) creativity, 2) physical health, 3) mental prowess, 4) overall knowledge and 5) grades.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
My vigor for school is vanishing. I must, starting today – starting immediately after I finish my morning pages and check my mail – get back into the groove that held my needle in January. I have to play the tune of commitment to many hours of study so I can put more and more chunks of classwork, insipid as some of it seems, behind me. I am awestruck in the sight of those capable of holding fast to a study schedule and churn out exactly what the professors who preside want. They are portentous in that they will get this behaviour pattern through with sooner than I. They are players of the pattern, shaped by the American way and what is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. As I might say, my pattern is smooth, rubbed off. The original was stamped somewhere in my brain, but my conciousness took a file to it long ago. I would not be who I am today if this had not happened; I would be a harnessed horse like the rest, surely, but my own state, on which as maze I must, myself, carve, prevents me, subtly, from obtaining by the same means, what others find natural: IE, the will to work and &lt;em&gt;succeed&lt;/em&gt; in society’s mold. I must find a way to drive myself, alchemy myself some social gasoline so as not to jump into a pattern that I despise, but to run along side with freewheels (much like a car runs along side a train) to get to one or two of the same destinations – a diploma, a job and money enough to leave this fucking pit of a nation for good. I will have to borrow fuel from sources I can only barely imagine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am a fortunate soul (or rather, spirit flapping like a tattered flag forewarning of coming thunderstorms) in that I don’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;grades&lt;/em&gt; any longer. Regardless of the dribble I wrote on 27 March 1995, I don’t think I seriously worried about them then, either, because most of my courses were metrically valuable. There was a bit of creativity involved in the steps to solving certain differential equations, but not much. The resultant &lt;em&gt;grade&lt;/em&gt; was clearly calculable. Life after university isn’t so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My experience with &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; work during the epochs since university can be summed up by what the lanky German dude whose name I forget told me in 2003. That company was &lt;em&gt;Extech&lt;/em&gt;. He told me that hirings were made 10% by demonstrable technical merit and 90% by gut / emotion / intuition. I’m not surprised that the company ceased to exist shortly afterwards. That had nothing to with me, of course, or I don’t think it did, anyway, as I was only in it for a quick buck until they figured out I was only in it for a quick buck. It was the attitude of the owner, of the lanky German dude whose name I forget, that killed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t have a problem, necessarily, with &lt;em&gt;family businesses&lt;/em&gt;, per se, but think the concept shouldn’t extend beyond small, justifiably dubbed &lt;em&gt;mom &amp; pops&lt;/em&gt; and the apprenticeship model. When the &lt;em&gt;family business&lt;/em&gt; mentality extends into technology or creativity oriented businesses, I’ve experienced nothing but direness. I’ve drifted to this topic because it is an example of &lt;em&gt;hiring by gut feeling&lt;/em&gt; or, better, &lt;em&gt;hiring by emotion&lt;/em&gt; (or emotional blackmail?). Hanging out in companies that brought in project managers and even programmers and graphic designers because they were &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;old university drinking buddies&lt;/em&gt; has resulted in my own practically endless personal amusement. This amusement involved watching new &lt;em&gt;compañeros de trabajo&lt;/em&gt;, some suddenly my “bosses”, with minimal technical or design skills but sizeable egos, slowly poison their departments. Developers and graphic designers began dropping out like runners suddenly realising their marathon is a farce. They dropped out not because of a sudden vanishing of their skillset. They dropped out because of a occlusion in the workflow of the department and of the company as a whole. The &lt;em&gt;friends and family&lt;/em&gt; new hires and their unchecked egos wreaked havoc. Fuck um. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At least I only have one fuckup to deal with work-relatedly during this epoch, and I know him strictly on a professional level. Oh, wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, which is several mornings after I first started this entry, as the vim process sits open on the Raspberry Pi I call &lt;em&gt;Yak&lt;/em&gt; and therefore I intermittently add to it, helping Christián, as foul a person as he is, with his website reminded me of something Craig used to do, repeatedly, during that other epoch which was my time at Texas A&amp;M university. Were Craig asked for help in something programming or system administration related, he would &lt;strong&gt;gladly&lt;/strong&gt; help, but only to an extent. One, if not several, of the puzzle pieces would always be left undone for the asker to complete. The puzzle would be simplified, sure, but asker for help, in the end, always would have to help him / her / itself at least a bit. Craig would have made a great teacher. I respect my old friend’s behavior emanating from that ancient epoch more and more as I grow into decrepitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Concerning the harnessed horse: Since I am currently a form of harnessed horse, I need to sculpt the routine into a path as productive as possible. This is a time of transition in my life, a time that began roughly at the end of 2015. The harness solidified from steamy potential into something that drove me, though I was partly the one driving. My living situation was the other driver. It still is. In a way, it is frustrating and confining. On the other hand, I have had the most creative years since the late 90s / early 00s since the purchase of my blue Telecaster, which I have failed to give a name to, in November of 2016. Fifteen years of debauchery puro, of the so-called &lt;em&gt;bohemian life&lt;/em&gt; is exemplary of where a big part of my mind still wants to be. Oh, and Sweet Entropy will take me there again one fine day. Let’s just see how many albums I can churn out before that one fine day comes around.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
I wonder what makes my upper torso smell good. On the days I wash my hair (every other day), Marcie always claims I smell very good, but, on the other days, I wash my face, neck and armpits with the same shampoo that my hair is cleansed with. Perhaps my hair influences my smell more than I can reckon from simple observation. If I shaved it off, I would not have this problem, surely, but I shall not. My hair is important now and I can’t get rid of it. It models a part of my personality as surely as the way my mouth twists into sardonic smirk when confronted with mindless blather from a typical teenager. Gandy, irresponsible, lethargic, helpless, immobile, stagnant, fertile, bombastic, burlesque, niggardly – which world does not go with the rest?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What kind of arrogant tripe is this? I am enjoying parts of this ancient journal I’m going through, but bits like this are laughable. I get that babble from teens can be tiring, and I was, indeed, in a relationship with a teen at the time. And if I recall correctly, I had many arguments with said teen about what it means to babble, what proper adults would call &lt;em&gt;small talk&lt;/em&gt;. I’m still not a fan even if I see its utility. I’ll let myself float away on the arrogance carpet and say that at this point in my life, I am beyond any need for &lt;em&gt;small talk&lt;/em&gt;. Fuck um. It’s possible that I floated on the &lt;em&gt;arrogance carpet&lt;/em&gt; frequently during my 20s. I was certainly what Acy liked to call an &lt;em&gt;intellectual elitist&lt;/em&gt;. Somewhere in the intervening decades, I leaped off that carpet, perhaps still floating high above the undulating floorings, and plunged into the funnel of humility. I passed through the infinitely narrow tube at the vertex and emerged an infinitely long chain of single quarks spanning the dance between the original cosmic bead and the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
I just received a letter from the municipal court of Houston, surely declaring that my check bounced and I owe them a lot of money - $150 to be exact. My money situation is grim, actually. I owe Friendswood court $138 and Houston municipal, as noted, $150. Where the hell am I going to come up with the money? I’ll leave it up to God and his little guardian angels who flutter ‘round my head like moths around a blazing bulb.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
On the same note - I wonder when my Hawkwind t-shirts are going to come in - or if they are going to come in. The email about them was hauntingly ambiguous, keeping me up nights wond’ring aloud about the eventual outcome.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Happiness is a warm, glowing lamp shining on the pages of good science fiction. Drolling is inevitable when morning pages are in the works.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Do I sense some sort of excavation? My senses sometimes evaporate into a sort of ghoul watching from afar. One of my biggest problems is, when trying to concentrate, my mind goes into “meta-mode”, and starts thinking about trying to concentrate on something instead of actually concentrating on it like it should be doing. I’ll be sitting Zazen, counting, and finding myself doing well, following the numbers, then gasp because I was not following the numbers at all but &lt;em&gt;thinking about following them&lt;/em&gt;. It is this hierarchy that scares me. I feel my mind has already made up its mind about how it shall work forever and my concentration powers are ka-plooie, no good, wasted, curtailed, precluded, fundamentally fucked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m pretty sure that I never received a Hawkwind t-shirt of any kind. I could order one now to make up for it. I could order three! Having checked with Redbubble, the source of my &lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; t-shirts, I verified there are a number of Hawkwind ones, though mostly the usual suspects: &lt;em&gt;In Search of Space&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Ritual&lt;/em&gt;, etc. No &lt;em&gt;Levitation&lt;/em&gt;, but I paid out of the snout for &lt;em&gt;Church of Hawkwind&lt;/em&gt;. Odlično! According to the recent album grids I did, it’s, after all, one of the albums that &lt;strong&gt;changed things&lt;/strong&gt; for me. Though those grids were semi-arbitrary, I should dedicate a few blog entries to going through how my very &lt;strong&gt;soul&lt;/strong&gt; was subsumed into each of the albums scattered within them. Should I make a mental note of it? Mental notes don’t function well for me, being subsumed into the murkiness of synaptic infinity. Should I make a Joplin note of it? Will it come to anything? Let’s stake our bets, Herr Reader of this Rambling Void. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m still plagued by the problem I described on 24 March, 1995. My mind is a multi-level abstraction generation demon. That last sentence was an attempt to type like James sometimes talks. The whole of this paragraph so far is an example of the plague I wrote about on 24 March, 1995. One thing that has tamed this savage part of my module-sphere is guitar practise. Oh, I concentrate! Unlike now, obviously. The harmonium emanating from the twin near-field monitors aside my desk, because of its sheer beauty, interferes with even stepping up and down that ladder of metas. However, that is sheer distraction, not thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven’t sat Zazen in centuries. Possibly the last time I seriously did something similar consistently was during summer of 2001, though it was a &lt;em&gt;walking Zazen&lt;/em&gt;, performed on my way from the S-bahn to work and back again every day. My breathing and steps subsumed me. I was bathed in shimmering light, dissolved into the quantum foam and never seen or heard from again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This entry is full of true stories. Stories that bathe you in shimmering light and dissolve you into the quantum foam so that you are never seen or heard from again. The end of ever story is the same, regardless of being bathed in shimmering light and being dissolved into the quantum foam and never being seen or heard from again. They are all tumbling down the same funnel into the same infinitely narrow spout.&lt;/p&gt;

There is just Shambal Brambel, sitting sessile on his bed, on an unnamed moon. Breezes howl against the vacant space around the vast pine box surrounding him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
You can’t live your life in a pine box, mister. The kitchen yawned as I walked into its midst this morning, then settled back into some sort of dumb, droning daftness that kitchens are known for. I opened the refrigerator to obtain my morning meal. The garbage can stood like a dungheap in defiance of anyone who dared move it, try to sink clean hands into its murky recesses, grasping for, perhaps, some sort of handle to use for easy carrying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can certainly live your life in a gypsum plasterboard box, however, mister. Until minutes before (or even &lt;strong&gt;moments&lt;/strong&gt; before) writing the last sentence, I did not know that &lt;em&gt;pladur&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;plasterboard&lt;/em&gt; in English. The only time I was part of the &lt;em&gt;bubble&lt;/em&gt; that is construction (of houses / apartments / woodsheds / kennels / yawning archways to the passively malignant stars / etc) was when I was 9 or 10 (I’d have to consult my father) during the construction of what we later, even decades later, called the &lt;em&gt;new room&lt;/em&gt; in the house I grew up in. So there you go, hoss. &lt;em&gt;Pladur&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;plasterboard&lt;/em&gt; in English. You have learned a new word, as have I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
But -&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can certainly live your life in a gypsum pladur box, however, mister. When I walked into our plasterboard kitchen, it did not yawn, nor did it mutter obscenities at me as I reached for the &lt;em&gt;English Breakfast&lt;/em&gt; tin box that actually contains &lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;. After banging the mesh time and again on the inside of the garbage bin until I considered it clean, I sprayed it with what I consider &lt;em&gt;the hose&lt;/em&gt;, placed it in its place in the tea kettle gifted to me by proxy from Lidl, and filled it with 92 degree water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I squatted and considered the garbage bin. It was practically empty, very unlike a dungheap, and in fact smelled pleasant. I gave it a small shove to see it if would react. It wobbled then settled back into place. I continued to consider, but this time the distance, superficiality and stark difference between two distant snapshots in a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
My cereal did not snap, crackle nor pop when it was suddenly awash with a bowl full of milk. I always fill the bowl too full of milk and waste. That excess (that part that doesn’t get eaten directly with the cereal) goes down the drain of the sink. Would I be some sort of phobe in never drinking the remaining portions of milk? I hope not. Phobes are, unlike Phoebes, not squishy and sometimes fun to fuck.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The chair titillates my back - the lumbar part - so I sit up straighter to alleviate the uncomfortable poking sensation - not that a chair can necessarily poke, being that poking is an active action, but perhaps &lt;em&gt;jut&lt;/em&gt;, since to jut you don’t very well have to be sentient. I’m glad I clarified that poking will be, by me, always used only in the sense of a sentient creature mindfully willing the act, whereas jutting can be accomplished by just about anyone or anything of particularly any geometric structure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve mentioned to Herr Neumann many times that I don’t eat cereal. Well - the proof is typewritten for all to see. I used to eat cereal. Obviously not the type that snapped, crackled or popped, however. The idea of the excess milk spiraling down the drain amuses me. It also reminds me of another ancient journal entry where I wrote of standing in front of a toilet, urinating, and always flushing before the stream concluded, attempting to time the whole urination resolution correctly. The connection with the milk is tenuous, but my associative module in the squishy mass of cerebral tissue housed in some cranium or another is always alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pouring the excess milk down the drain also reminds me of the sheer defiance I used to have of &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; established norm, even in the private of my own home with nothing but a few synths and a guitar as witnesses. That defiance still lives within me, though it is diluted with time and compromise. I long to reawaken its vigor, though direct like a scalpel, not as the scattershot rifle of decades gone by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jutting&lt;/em&gt; is frequent in sentient objects, I have found. Its most frequent in those sentient objects that are considered either family, close friends, compañeros de trabajo or assholes in general. Unlike &lt;em&gt;poking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;jutting&lt;/em&gt; performed by sentient objects is usually passive. They obtrude into your space, always a constant burr in the lumbar portion of the back, usually to remind you something must be performed, done usually ritually, habitually and with more and more listlessness as life goes by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My cynicism certainly doesn’t wane with time. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
You cannot live your life in a pine box. Lee asked to be buried in an unmarked pine box. I still wonder if he got his wish. He certainly was, posthumously, denied one of his requests – that of not having a funeral. The loving bastards went and mourned his decaying body just like he hoped they wouldn’t. Oh well – some people can’t be stopped from doing the right thing and fucking things up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The types of boxes that people live in are what I call &lt;em&gt;bubbles&lt;/em&gt;. It’s possible that some of those bubbles are made of pine. I’d say that it’s even likely. The smell is pleasant. Who wouldn’t want to live in a pine bubble? Since the bubbles themselves are a psychological or cultural or mental construct to begin with, the material of their construction is immaterial. So, in this regard, we all live in pine boxes and in pine boxes within other pine boxes. We even live in pine boxes intersecting with other pine boxes. Sometimes the pine is less opaque than it should be. It can even be translucent or fully transparent, though the idea of said box / bubble / whathaveyou might break down at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Decades later, I don’t think about Lee’s demise as much, naturally. The quoted parts of this blog entry are from a spiral notebook written during the spring of 1995. That part of my tramp through the pasture was one of imminent transition, and the feeling coincides with my current position in the pasture. Time slithers alongside differently as age subsumes me, showing me the gelling decades being absorbed into the passage itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Herr Christián mentioned that he considers the &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt; those that feel their ilk, meaning those closest to them, meaning their families, deserve to be in some means &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; others. In that the so-called &lt;strong&gt;nobility&lt;/strong&gt; in the forlorn times was something akin (pun intended) a giant family, he is correct. Familiarity breeds a feeling of superiority, a group-think nobility. This idea extends from the family to the community and to the city and nation. It is another form of bubble, and concentric bubbles with varying degrees of permeability, unifying in one sense, but beds of xenophobia in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Shambal says, &lt;strong&gt;fuck um&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tentacles of the Ruling Class</title>

I started reading &lt;em&gt;The Lost Art of Scripture&lt;/em&gt; by Karen Armstrong yesterday. I read another one of her books in my early twenties and it helped spawn a part of my life very interested in exploring religion, myth and their effects on culture and the people I knew at the time. During more recent decades, I’ve separated religion from what Karen calls the arts and left it in a box to rot under the bed in the apartment I lived in back then in Houston. Perhaps part of the present &lt;em&gt;Bobbus&lt;/em&gt; wants to summon a bit of that past &lt;em&gt;Bobbus&lt;/em&gt; and re-explore those concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly, a mental struggle against ideologues throughout my existence has engendered cynicism. I’ve come close, but I wouldn’t say I’ve ever completely immersed myself in atheism. I’ve always retained at least a small sense of wonder for the ineffable. Karen states repeatedly in the introduction of the book, we cannot discount logos for mythos nor vice-versa, and I am in complete agreement. In fact, as I wrote, religion and its &lt;em&gt;scriptures&lt;/em&gt; and ritual surrounding them were always a part of the arts. Just recently (century-wise), occidental culture has moved to quash that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Grinding the ideologues up into fertilizer for the plants on my balcony is the first step. The second is to immerse myself once again in the shifting dialogue between mythos and logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing that hit me was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
We shall see that in every agrarian society, a small aristocracy, together with its retainers, seized the surplus grown by their peasants and used it to fund their cultural projects, forcing ninety per cent of the population to live at subsistence level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of mythos and the wisdom of &lt;em&gt;scriptures of old&lt;/em&gt;, I still stand firm in my belief that those who want to backtrack into some past system of ideology / laws to solve current problems (at whatever level of granularity) are imbeciles. In the world of art and music, it is equally or even more true. I’ve had numerous conversations with Herr Christián lately concerning the &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt; and its ties to classically trained musicians he knows, most notably his friend Krzys, an opera singer of “note” from some Slavic nation I forget the name of. (There are just so &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; of them!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What Karen states was once the unbending norm, but I posit that the &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt; no longer exists in any form resembling what it was in those forlorn times. A far greater percentage of humanity have &lt;em&gt;aristocratic&lt;/em&gt; beads hanging about its neck, each giving us time out of &lt;em&gt;serfdom&lt;/em&gt; to pursue cultural / artistic projects. Logos, or humanity’s success in technological progress, is the plinth on which we stand that brings us up to the level of the olden &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt;. Said classical purists who cling to the times where only the &lt;em&gt;chosen&lt;/em&gt; could enter into and flourish in the arts are living in a rapidly diminishing bubble. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

Habitually in Spain, it’s seen as &lt;strong&gt;maleducación&lt;/strong&gt; to directly tell someone you dislike what they have suggested to you or given to you as a gift. I suppose that to some extent, this practise would be considered &lt;strong&gt;maleducación&lt;/strong&gt; in most cultures. Sadly, its effects are detrimental to a relationship. In fact, the effects are so detrimental that I’d place them on the level of, say, binding one’s friend to an outcropping overlooking a churning sea of pus so that a &lt;strong&gt;goat&lt;/strong&gt; can consume his / her pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marisa’s sister, María Jose, bakes a fish cake every xmas for the entire family. Of course, the entire family despises the dish, though they are &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to consume it. Why are they &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to consume it? Well, they wish to spare María Jose’s feelings, of course! So she prepares it unfailingly each xmas. Wouldn’t it be better to make her feel bad for a short period by telling her the truth so that she can move on and spend her time baking something everyone will enjoy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The spongy wall of &lt;em&gt;appropriateness&lt;/em&gt; only allows certain acts to be criticized. Somehow it is proportional to how original or how &lt;strong&gt;traditional&lt;/strong&gt; the act is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Miguel suggested a semi-documentary for us to watch the other day. In my opinion, and also in Marisa’s, it is awful, detailing a part of life in the United States that we have no interest in. Miguel can revel in it. I don’t have a problem with that. But I’m not allowed to tell him that I disliked it. He’ll never be able to align his suggestions to what is actually enjoyable for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For most, this type of critique is reserved for their closest friends and &lt;strong&gt;sometimes&lt;/strong&gt; family. I task myself to break this cultural more. Fuck um. Humans that are close to me need to know when they are &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; something abominable so they can either form it into something more palatable or swap it out for a less abominable abomination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other sides to this story exist, of course, especially in the case of art and the importance (or lack thereof) of an &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt;, and if the point was to create an abomination in the first place. I’ve written about these topics before and shall again. The reader of this particular abomination is now tasked with baking a fish cake that is only moderately abominable.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to me that a certain percentage of the violation of nature that I call the &lt;strong&gt;human race&lt;/strong&gt; has an irksome habit. In fact, it’s so irksome, that many a times, I wish for these peasants to drown in their own blood. The paradox is that this &lt;strong&gt;habit&lt;/strong&gt;, in the correct context, can be positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I require concise answers to questions in my work, and not only in my work but in other aspects of my life. When I ask a colleague a question, I don’t want a slice of their inner dialog combined with a vague pretension of an answer. If said colleague doesn’t know the answer, then they can kindly point me in the right direction and spare me a snapshot of a turbid inner life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This malady is exacerbated when the person ostensibly answering my question is of the &lt;strong&gt;marketing&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;idea man&lt;/strong&gt; ilk. In fact, the tendency of this ilk to dish out a slice of inner dialog instead of giving tight, controlled answers leads me to the conclusion that they all are better off used as fertilizer for my opium farm. To counter my complaints, such “people” answer with enlightenments along the lines of &lt;strong&gt;well, my mind is so rich with ideas that I cannot contain myself&lt;/strong&gt;. Write it in a fucking blog. What you find to be insight is mostly dribble. Someone else can sort through the ramblings to find the 0.46% that may be of value to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The illness springs from the &lt;strong&gt;storyteller&lt;/strong&gt; archetype - the old man in the center of the ring who recounts (highly edited and enhanced) tales of his tedious life. This archetype lives strong in self-proclaimed entertainers in our epoch, jokesters and other ego-addicts. My recommendation is to write a book or at least a blog. That way, if I spend time with the ramblings, at least I will have chosen to do so. Don’t bombard me with an inner dialog that you don’t have the willpower to tame and especially when I need a concise answer to a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
About the &lt;strong&gt;habit&lt;/strong&gt; being positive in the correct context - I changed my mind. They should all DIE.&lt;/p&gt;

I’m often overwhelmed by the amount of music that both exists and appeals to me on an immediate surface level. The question is, how do I choose which are &lt;strong&gt;worthy&lt;/strong&gt; of profound examination? My conclusion is that the choice is entirely arbitrary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I’ll elect a group / artist / project to explore by association with others I’ve previously delved into. Last year’s &lt;strong&gt;Utopia Strong&lt;/strong&gt; is a prime example, as it’s a Kavus Torabi project. I choose others because of &lt;strong&gt;social&lt;/strong&gt; association. Lately this means through acquaintences on Sonomu.Club. Historically, I’ve found much to like through acquaintences on &lt;strong&gt;progressiveears&lt;/strong&gt; (and in ancient times, rec.music.progressive). I also shouldn’t forget friends who ramble on and on about certain artists. I tend to check those out, as well, though at times with trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But again, the previous paragraph indicates over-saturation. I have to thin the elite herd and / or cherry-pick. These decisions to explore deeply, as I typed cheerily a few paragraphs ago, are arbitrary. Last year, I decided I’m going to be a fan of &lt;strong&gt;Lady With&lt;/strong&gt;. I had enjoyed what I heard and also other projects involving the composer, but it took a conscious decision to make time to &lt;strong&gt;get into&lt;/strong&gt; the musical universe of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m guessing youth saw me having more visceral reactions to musics and choosing explorations on a &lt;strong&gt;lizard brain&lt;/strong&gt; level. Those days are long dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Buddha Goes for Target Practise, Part IV</title>

Walking through the Pagan Park in Seminole, Texas, or perhaps whilst visiting the casino in Hobbs with my parents, a thought struck and amused me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Say that living beings (all of them) have some sort of primordial force that various humans term &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt;. This premise is frighteningly widespread. I say &lt;em&gt;frighteningly&lt;/em&gt; because I see myself as a rational guy who frowns and even scoffs at superstitions. To each his own, sure, but even novel and film related ghost stories give me problems these days. Perhaps it is my decrepitude. I am, after all, several epochs old. Anyway, that is a separate subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back on track - Say that living beings (each one of them) have a primordial interior force. It exists symbiotically with our living corpse, but doesn’t deteriorate with time. Various humans dub this &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;elephantine farce&lt;/em&gt;, depending on whom you ask. It doesn’t &lt;em&gt;cease&lt;/em&gt;, however, after the living corpse stops its elliptical ambulations. Taking the Buddhist standpoint, the primordial force passes directly into another living corpse after death. It makes sense to me that it’d elect a being &lt;em&gt;conceived&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;born&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;whatever moment you’d like to choose&lt;/em&gt; at the same instant of the aforementioned living corpse’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given this theory, a &lt;strong&gt;spirit&lt;/strong&gt; previously inhabiting a human has an infinitesimal chance of residing in another human. Most likely, that &lt;strong&gt;force&lt;/strong&gt; carries on in a paramecium or lichen. Personally, I hope my personal (I laughingly call it &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;) primordial force, wiped clean of those pesky memories, occupies a widely distributed slime mold. How’s that for megalomania?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Denial of Immediacy</title>

A recurring bump in interaction with a friend who will remain anonymous other than saying he has what I call the &lt;em&gt;Newman&lt;/em&gt; disease and both severe dyslexia and dyscalculia again happened yesterday. I suggested a course on Javascript using exercism.io, a useful site for learning programming languages at your own pace - ie, when you have free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, I got an offhand comment about &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt;, but nothing more. Same old story, different epoch. Usually, when I get this sort of response from someone, I blink a few times and move on with my life. Some humans and even mustelids are interested neither in taking general advice or in intellectual self-improvement. Specifically, some are just not interested in educational tasks that will take a (even sometimes very small) chunk of time even if rationally they understand it will diminish various other chunks of future time and especially alleviate frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Usually, I’d say &lt;em&gt;fuck um&lt;/em&gt; and move on, but this oxlet with &lt;em&gt;Newman&lt;/em&gt; disease (among others) is a particularly good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My impression is that there is an aversion here to any learning that doesn’t have &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; appeal. It’s an issue that pokes at my enlarged and pustulant liver because it also affected me for many epochs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My path through primary, middle and high school was so easy that I learned no useful study skills. I mastered everything hurled at me intuitively. I received a nasty blow to the ego when I walked into the University of Texas at Austin and not everything came so easily. I had to sit down and feel myself through a maze of knowledge without that intuitive olfactory sense that leads the precocious rat to the fermented mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tripped and found myself sprawled into a world where I had to grapple with knowledge and especially &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; to reach any sort of mastery. Bastards. Since, during my infancy and adolescence, I was showered with praise for my &lt;em&gt;gift&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, climbing the debris-littered slope probably took longer than for those who didn’t have it so “easy” during the formative years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These epochs, I’m wary of anything that comes completely intuitively. I realize that is possibly an extreme, but I find constant self-observation appealing. Hand me a platter of puzzles I must unlock to get at the foodstuffs instead of a steaming döner in a paper sack, please. The hunger will encourage discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The appeal of immediacy is undeniable, but just like plunging into a long term relationship simply because another human or mustelid is feisty in the burrow, initial wonder can lead to debris dodging and bug fixing for epochs to come. I haven’t seen a concise proportional measure ‘tween effort and reward, but am pretty sure always taking the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, intuitive path doesn’t work out so well for &lt;strong&gt;anyone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Murderous Flash</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/444.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/444.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, in the early evening, I had a flash like a sudden fever that struck me then left, but returned in reverberating waves during the following hours. The feeling had subsided completely by the time I passed into sleep hours later, but the thought structure it left behind remained. It still remains today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The collection of wealth for its own sake is an abomination. Moreover, the collection of wealth to pool into a &lt;em&gt;family trust&lt;/em&gt; is equally evil. Common regurgitations I perceive are along the lines of &lt;em&gt;I’m saving so my children can have a better life&lt;/em&gt;. But what these egocentric oafs are really doing is teaching the same behaviour to the offspring in effort to hoard wealth into a &lt;em&gt;dynasty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s somewhat the same as the mafia strategy, concentrating hoardings in the family throughout generations to no ends but augmenting the &lt;em&gt;pile&lt;/em&gt;. The dragon in &lt;em&gt;Grendel&lt;/em&gt; floats to mind, but on a hereditary scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being a speciesist, or even a proponent of all life, in general, I find concentrations of power, wealth, or any sort of potential detrimental to what I feel is the &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;. I can only peripherally understand it from the point of view of the hoarders, assume their motives, of course, but the &lt;em&gt;portion&lt;/em&gt; I understand sickens me. I strikes like a fever at this &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;, which seems to be diverted and diluted again and again by generational wealth hoarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Gather a pile of gold and sit on it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m about to use the word &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; extensively in the following paragraph. Thus, I am accused of instructing others in the way they should act. It could be seen as my own form of fundamentalism. So be it if it is seen that way. I write what I feel would improve the world in general, and in specific, relations between &lt;em&gt;communities&lt;/em&gt; in our species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My thoughts are that each individual, and on less granular scale, each &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;peer group&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt;, should to make a contribution from their hoarding to the &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;. These contributions should be anonymous so they do not cause a fluctuation in the aesthetic perception of said individual or group. They shouldn’t be a one time thing, akin to a  religious act of being &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; by the one time scandal of letting the Jesus creature into their lives.  Direct application of &lt;em&gt;funds&lt;/em&gt; can be substituted by substantial acts of kindness. Either way, a portion of the wealth hoard is diffused back into the &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My seething hatred at those who pile their gold solely for their kin and for no other reason to &lt;strong&gt;pile their gold&lt;/strong&gt; and teach their offspring to do the same has faded. The impression remains. The seething hatred has faded, but I’d still not mind were many of them used as fertilizer. We need more fertilizer around here, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Task for my Pet Tardigrade and its Multitudinous Foals</title>

Taylor asked me yesterday what are five things I did during the decade that is coming to a close that made it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before I begin a formal list, I’ll say the overreaching concept that made the decade &lt;em&gt;worth it&lt;/em&gt; was the sheer enjoyment of as many moments as possible during the said decade. Being that a &lt;em&gt;moment&lt;/em&gt; can be regarded as an infinetesimal span of time, I had the possibility to experience infinite enjoyable moments, causing death by cerebral hemorrhage in several infinities of parallel quantum universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
I started seriously composing and playing music again.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;dearth of music&lt;/em&gt; years were between 2002 and 2008, more or less. During that time, I tossed away any aspiration of even picking up my guitar, much less letting it speak into the antiquated tape machines I still held on to for years. I certainly didn’t give up &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; intently to music, however, and attended many concerts. Those are other stories that may or may not be told in this or some other member of some other infinity of parallel quantum universes. I don’t encourage you to wait for their telling, though you may do so, if you so wish. I will not be held responsible, however, if you wither and dessicate during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2010, when I lived in New Cross Gate, I earnestly dabbled with electronic music for the first time. Ironically, now that I’ve incorporated modular synth and whimsical Supercollider forays into my compositions, none of that original dabbling has &lt;em&gt;seen the light&lt;/em&gt;. One piece, &lt;em&gt;The Fen&lt;/em&gt;, will eventually be resurrected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tony and I created a collection of improvisations, some of which I’m afraid to relisten to, during the following year. We also worked on some crudities I wrote in 2008 whilst living in Hůrka. &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.bandcamp.com/track/fold&quot;&gt;Fold&lt;/a&gt; is a “modern” version of one of those crudities. I plan to pull &lt;em&gt;Union&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reduction&lt;/em&gt; from their tombs, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, I composed &lt;em&gt;Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, a seventeen minute or so piece deeply set in a ravine of minimalism. A version exists purely as midi. This template can be expanded and mechanically fleshed by electronics, guitar and gargling voices set bringing an end to the plague that is the “American” way of life and that has poisoned so much of Europe. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another few dead years followed during which I frittered about in Boston and tampered with the destiny of Mustelids in Spain. Whilst remaning in Spain I bought a utter trozo de hovno kytara &lt;em&gt;Pignose&lt;/em&gt; and started practising again. I didn’t at first consider composing or revising past &lt;em&gt;glories&lt;/em&gt;, but just practising. I practised until my fingers bled. I practised until my liver drooped from my abdomen. I practised until the Heat Death of a few infinities of parallel quantum universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent 2017 and the first few months of 2018 playing in a &lt;em&gt;duo&lt;/em&gt;. As little as I cared for the humour or attitute of my partner in this venture, my point of view expanded and those dank days flowered into whatever sort of monstrosities one could describe the first few Flavigula albums as. I dumped the duo and the rancid individual I was strung up with, tossed away my noose and dove into the psychedelic maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
I became better at letting go / not obsessing about &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fixations take up chunks of time in the lives of many people I know. Not only are they &lt;em&gt;fixations&lt;/em&gt;, but fixations on things that do absolutely nothing to further their intellectual or creative (or both) pursuits. I’ve gone to great lengths to dissolve an obsessive compulsive disorder I had. Best is the ability to concentrate on what I want to concentrate without some mental module I have no control of sucking away my time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or, one might say, I became more of a &lt;em&gt;sociopath&lt;/em&gt;. That would be the correct perception since I have become Catholic and therefore see all life in discreet blocks of black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My oversensitive persona of youth and 20s had been fading for some time, in any case. The road to a firmer self realization and self esteem had already been tread. The decade simply saw these facets become more prominent. Marisa calls it Aspergers. Whatever one wants to call it, I find it a blessing from the almighty Baal itself. Yes - I will speak my mind. Yes - I will care little of what you think of me (unless I know you very well). But also I’ll listen to your reasoned discourse. Put away your mannered ravings. They do not appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
I narrowed my fields of concentration.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following in the footsteps of my desensitization to the majority of humanity, I felt mortality encroaching from a vague distance. The realization that time is limited is something most are not willing to approach during their youths, or if so, only in a bombastic or melodramatic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to be happy being a mustelid of broad knowledge. Now my objective is to be a mustelid of profound knowledge in a limited number of areas. Ok, &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; may be too specific a word here. Simply put, I limit my concetration to fields that interest me most, such as music, programming and worshipping goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In stark contrast to these self-absorbed pursuits, I tasked myself with opening myself to empathy that I’d rejected so long. Having been raised in the hellish &lt;em&gt;entorno&lt;/em&gt; of Fort Stockton, it’s been a arduous journey recuperating genuine compassion for humanity. I believe my love for animal life and mustelidae in specific assisted this eternal work in progress. Constant observation of ignorance and stupidity in every village square has not done much to assist this eternal work in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 &amp; 5. I’ll have to think of other abstractions that have been important to me in the receding decade. Perhaps I’ll come up with something soon, but, as I wrote earlier, don’t dessicate waiting for me to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A list of discreet occurances that pivoted my life during the receding decade (or ones that I feel could be pivot points influencing the encroaching decade):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Lisa Kammerud (December, 2009, actually)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Tuzla, as a discreet, three month point  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Metting Jeremy Croteau  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Starting a company with James  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Connecting with my biological son  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Matthew Walsh  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Daniel García  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Two short films with Dani (as discreet points)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Tiit Maran  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Marisa  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>My Collection of Originalities is Thinning</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/442.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/442.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
In brief conversation with Marisa’s mother, Ilu, I encountered an ingrained form of response, or so it seemed to me. I stated &lt;em&gt;We are leaving within an hour.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Marcharemos dentro de una hora.&lt;/em&gt;) and she immediately came back with &lt;em&gt;Or even sooner!&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;O incluso más pronto!&lt;/em&gt;). I immediately correct her, as I am wont to do. Some call me a &lt;em&gt;pedant&lt;/em&gt; for such behaviours. Fuck um. Nothing against Ilu, but I find such responses a symptom of sloppy thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like to hang back a bit with my thoughts before coming out with the first phrase that tingles my tongue. I’m unsure if I am among the majority that &lt;em&gt;perform&lt;/em&gt; this way. I’m all for saying what’s on one’s mind, but when those thoughts come out in &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt; or stock phrases, I wonder about the precision of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus the central point of this entry. As I grow towards decrepitude, shrinking further into the groaning corporeal husk that houses my hara, I find myself surrounded more and more frequently by people who, instead of discursive conversation, resort to retorting in phrases which seem carved into their mental language tablets as if into stone. Certain stock phrases recur, recited in various orders to achieve various level of vagary. I’m aware that I am suppose to &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; the meaning behind each black box after black bundle of words. I should interperet them in context just like a set a gesticulations. However, this process leaves me deeply dissatisfied. I don’t want to talk to a magician who has a bag containing a set number of stock phrases. He pulls one after another from said bag, sorts and assembles them as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An interesting assement of &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt;, as they are called in Spanish, is that they tend to create tighter bonds between community members, especially of those &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt; are particularly local. They toughen the skin of the bubble. In other words, they further isolate the community from the outside with a barrier of impenetrable phrasiology. An outsider will have a harder time integrating when they don’t know the inner significance of &lt;em&gt;three noses to the wind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;he buried a pumkin near the ravine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One could argue that such &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt; give a particular bubble (community) flavour of its own, differentiating it from multitudinous other bubbles wielding their own stock phrases. My view is that this &lt;em&gt;tendency&lt;/em&gt; is a barrier to fluid communications between bubbles and a barrier to globalism. It’s a small step towards culture-centrism, nationalism and a type of fundamentalism that irks me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How I Ruptured my Cerebrum Implementing Activity Pub</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/441.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/441.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I spent a few months on and off, that is to say, not very consistently, attempting to get this blog &lt;strong&gt;Activity Pub Sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;. There were many false starts, many moments where I gave up, many spilled comestibles and one or two plagues of sentient lice. In the end, my implementation is far from &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;, but it does what I need it to do for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m in metaphysical debt to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/ActivityPub-as-it-has-been-understood&quot;&gt;Activity Pub as it has Been Understood&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinysubversions.com/notes/reading-activitypub/&quot;&gt;How to Read the Activity Pub Specification&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary&quot;&gt;Activty Streams Vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#followers&quot;&gt;Activity Pub Specification&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My code is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Martenblog is a single user federated app, so, unlike #mastodon or Pleroma. This &lt;em&gt;single user&lt;/em&gt; is the manifestation of the blog, perhaps, were it sentient. Perhaps it is. I’m not sure. Whereas &lt;strong&gt;Actors&lt;/strong&gt; on Mastodon are indicated by &lt;code&gt;https://instance/users/username&lt;/code&gt; (I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;&gt;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon), my singular actor is &lt;code&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&lt;/code&gt;. I didn’t come up with this genericism myself, but by stealing the idea from … well, it seems I cannot find the repository any longer. I am also in metaphysical debt to this &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; who did a Node.js implementation for his own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -k https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&lt;/code&gt; will show you my actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Backtracking slightly, I found it necessary to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033&quot;&gt;webfinger&lt;/a&gt; so that other servers could see me. My initial testing goal was to be able to type @martenblog@flavigula.net into the search field on Mastodon and find the manifestation of Martenblog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  def webfinger do
    json = %{
      aliases: [
        &quot;https://#{@domain}/ap/actor&quot;
      ],
      links: [
        %{
          href: &quot;https://#{@domain}/ap/actor&quot;,
          rel: &quot;self&quot;,
          type: &quot;application/activity+json&quot;
        }
      ],
      subject: &quot;acct:martenblog@#{@domain}&quot;
    }
    json
  end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suppose that’s pretty self explanatory. You can see the result at &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/webfinger&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/webfinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I was at it, I added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/host-meta&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/host-meta&lt;/a&gt; endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;XRD xmlns=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Link rel=&quot;lrdd&quot; template=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}&quot; type=&quot;application/xrd+xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/XRD&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo&lt;/a&gt; endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo/2.0.json&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.1&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo/2.1.json&quot;
    }
  ]
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the two endpoints referenced within nodeinfo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.0&quot;,
  &quot;usage&quot;: {
    &quot;users&quot;: {
      &quot;total&quot;: 1,
      &quot;activeMonth&quot;: 1,
      &quot;activeHalfyear&quot;: 1
    },
    &quot;localPosts&quot;: 419
  },
  &quot;software&quot;: {
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Martenblog&quot;
  },
  &quot;services&quot;: {
    &quot;outbound&quot;: [],
    &quot;inbound&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;protocols&quot;: [
    &quot;activitypub&quot;
  ],
  &quot;openRegistrations&quot;: false
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;version&quot;: &quot;2.1&quot;,
  &quot;usage&quot;: {
    &quot;users&quot;: {
      &quot;total&quot;: 1,
      &quot;activeMonth&quot;: 1,
      &quot;activeHalfyear&quot;: 1
    },
    &quot;localPosts&quot;: 419
  },
  &quot;software&quot;: {
    &quot;version&quot;: &quot;1.0.0&quot;,
    &quot;repository&quot;: &quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir.git&quot;,
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Martenblog&quot;
  },
  &quot;services&quot;: {
    &quot;outbound&quot;: [],
    &quot;inbound&quot;: []
  },
  &quot;protocols&quot;: [
    &quot;activitypub&quot;
  ],
  &quot;openRegistrations&quot;: false
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code for those are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&lt;/a&gt; along with every endpoint of my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I only want to &lt;em&gt;federate&lt;/em&gt; blog entries to people who follow me from other regions of the Fediverse. An api endpoint exists for this, appropriately named &lt;em&gt;followers&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/followers&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/followers&lt;/a&gt;) Though I implemented the endpoint and find it likely that it is required to do so to have a functioning server, the resulting &lt;em&gt;collection&lt;/em&gt; didn’t serve as I thought it should according to my interpretation of the specifications. I’ll come back to that later, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One must accrue followers. That is, I’m not going to send blog entries arbitrarily out to fediverse entities. So, when someone follows Martenblog, it receives something along these lines to the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; (that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/inbox):&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/inbox):&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Follow&quot;,
  &quot;object&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://sonomu.club/94904728-1d32-4a51-b422-0373323ec61c&quot;,
  &quot;actor&quot;: &quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;,
  &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code takes this json and wraps it in an &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Accept&quot;,
  &quot;object&quot;: {
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Follow&quot;,
    &quot;object&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://sonomu.club/94904728-1d32-4a51-b422-0373323ec61c&quot;,
    &quot;actor&quot;: &quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;,
    &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;
  },
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/48394fc9-114a-4849-86e4-3b78226915d9&quot;,
  &quot;actor&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and sends it on its way, which will be explained next, as it is the most complex bit. The &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; endpoint in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&lt;/a&gt; sends the &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; activity to the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; function in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/activitypub.ex,&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/activitypub.ex,&lt;/a&gt; which calls the &lt;code&gt;accept&lt;/code&gt; function in the same file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Implementing the &lt;em&gt;sending an activity to another Fediverse server&lt;/em&gt; part was like excoriating myself with a rusty spanner, mainly because I couldn’t find a clear way to &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt; during development, so I was, as it were, programming blind, deaf, motionless and possibly without appendages whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def sign_and_send(activity, inbox) do
  target_domain = Fuzzyurl.from_string(inbox).hostname
  inbox_fragment = String.replace(inbox, &quot;https://#{target_domain}&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
  date_str = Utils.rfc2616_now 
  Logger.info &quot;Reading private key...&quot;
  {:ok, priv_key} = File.read(&quot;/home/polaris/keys/martenblog.pem&quot;)
  Logger.info &quot;priv_key: #{priv_key}&quot;
  string_to_sign = &quot;(request-target): post #{inbox_fragment}\nhost: #{target_domain}\ndate: #{date_str}&quot;
  [ rsa_entry | _ ] = :public_key.pem_decode(priv_key)
  decoded_key = :public_key.pem_entry_decode(rsa_entry)
  sign_me = :public_key.sign(string_to_sign, :sha256, decoded_key)
  signature = :base64.encode(sign_me)
  sig_header = &quot;keyId=\&quot;https://#{@domain}/ap/actor#main-key\&quot;,headers=\&quot;(request-target) host date\&quot;,algorithm=\&quot;rsa-sha256\&quot;,signature=\&quot;#{signature}\&quot;&quot;
  case Poison.encode activity do
    {:ok, json_activity} -&gt; 
      Logger.info &quot;sign_and_send -&gt; activity: #{json_activity}&quot;
      Logger.info &quot;string_to_sign: #{string_to_sign}&quot;
      Logger.info &quot;signature header: #{sig_header}&quot;
      Logger.info &quot;date_str: #{date_str}&quot;
      case :hackney.post(inbox, [
          Host: target_domain, 
          Date: date_str, 
          Signature: sig_header, 
          &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/ld+json; profile=\&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\&quot;&quot;,
          Accept: &quot;application/activity+json, application/ld+json&quot; 
        ], json_activity) do
        {:ok, res} -&gt; res
        error -&gt; error
      end
    error -&gt; error
  end 
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This function is invoked with the activity to be sent and the inbox of its recipient. In this case, said recipient would be the &lt;em&gt;actor&lt;/em&gt; from another federated site that sent me a &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; activity. I extract the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; of the actor who wants to follow me by grabbing the actor and extracting its &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; field. The &lt;code&gt;remote_actor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetch_actor&lt;/code&gt; functions do this. You may want to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/ap_resolver.ex,&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/ap_resolver.ex,&lt;/a&gt; also, which handles actors cached in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I diverged from the main point a bit. &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; receives the &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; to send and the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; of the remote actor to send it to. First, it calculates the &lt;code&gt;inbox_fragment&lt;/code&gt; from the remote &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt;. That’d be, say &lt;code&gt;/users/flavigula/inbox&lt;/code&gt;. Next, the date, which &lt;strong&gt;HAS&lt;/strong&gt; to be in this format: &lt;code&gt;Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&lt;/code&gt; - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-124&quot;&gt;rfc2616&lt;/a&gt; format. If you do not use that format, you will instantly be beheaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems that Pleroma is more flexible concerning the format of the date it receives. Mastodon is not. It &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be RFC2616. Take a look at the function &lt;code&gt;rfc2616_now&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/utils.ex.&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/utils.ex.&lt;/a&gt; Notice that I manually append GMT at the end. Since I use &lt;code&gt;DateTime.utc_now&lt;/code&gt;, the time zone is not relevant, but be warned that if you use a conversion tool that gives you &lt;code&gt;UTC&lt;/code&gt; as the time zone, your signature &lt;strong&gt;will be rejected by Mastodon servers&lt;/strong&gt;. Tacking on &lt;code&gt;GMT&lt;/code&gt; is my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mastodon uses this bit of Ruby to verify the date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def matches_time_window?
  begin
    time_sent = Time.httpdate(request.headers[&apos;Date&apos;])
  rescue ArgumentError
    return false
  end
  (Time.now.utc - time_sent).abs &lt;= 12.hours
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recall reading that the &lt;em&gt;window&lt;/em&gt; for submitting a response is +/- 30 seconds. Obviously, Mastodon thinks otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometime before you get to this point, you need to have generated a public / private key pair. If you don’t know how to perform these duties, check out the following url: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/.&quot;&gt;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/.&lt;/a&gt; It also complements several processes I’ve already described, so is generally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, Herr &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; fetches my private key and constructs the so called &lt;code&gt;string_to_sign&lt;/code&gt;, which his this aspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(request-target): post /users/flavigula/inbox
host: sonomu.club
date: Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The function continues by decoding my private key, signing the key via &lt;em&gt;sha256&lt;/em&gt;, and encoding the result via &lt;em&gt;base64&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the tools you use to perform these three steps will vary depending on your language. I’m hanging out with Elixir at the moment and the procedure is carried out by functions from the underlying Erlang system (note they all start with &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;). The aforementioned &lt;em&gt;blog.joinmastodon.org&lt;/em&gt; url details the same steps in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;sig_header&lt;/code&gt;, an amalgam of the preceeding steps, comes out similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;keyId=&quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor#main-key&quot;,headers=&quot;(request-target) host date&quot;,algorithm=&quot;rsa-sha256&quot;,signature=&quot;VHYpjLbjhxwsVwOQTPzsbzzSkqCHXRtnhUp3CYYJsXRcdosKAeSHKShm3OuwCLlyx7iLvsU7y+jN2i4zrf2nLfAi6ujXqUBxsfrtHXBaLkjMyypRZ6eYwprZvZsDgWQ0v+M1E2KsWowlLINpAWGG9Nydh4wCa37RB7sAhqv/Ccdp57FACT5O9DQFUccgko93Yns4Amo7ZWtKth0QAR4H5bILe8lLGa0E6IfgyX1SSuitXRMqVsd8RDPY9ARKUl7arge6mPNl9WFtxPjNzhfXIiEYn7VHIt1WA82ungMnNUy6+aOOrBwJWu8BDYOlZT+Sl5/qN91ggjjtgq7vT+qjrA==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, you can &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; the activity to the foreign inbox. Again, I’m using Erlang - &lt;em&gt;hackney&lt;/em&gt; to be exact. Set the &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;application/ld+json; profile=\&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or be beheaded once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On to sending actual blog entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wrapping an entry into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-article&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, I get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%{
  &quot;@context&quot;: [&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;],
  attributedTo: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  cc: [],
  content: &quot;&lt;p&gt;Strange how these days remind me...&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,
  id: &quot;https://flavigula.net/entry/by-id/4&quot;,
  name: &quot;Winter eve&quot;,
  published: &quot;Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&quot;,
  to: [&quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;],
  type: &quot;Article&quot;,
  url: &quot;https://flavigula.net/#/blog/2006/12/8&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… constructed by the &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;activitypub.ex&lt;/code&gt;. Though I didn’t find reference to it in documentation anywhere (but I honestly didn’t look for more than twenty six seconds), the &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; field provides a nice link using the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of an article federated to Pleroma. Mastodon ends up with the contents of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field followed by the url. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Elixir &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; (that’s the construction you see above that begins with &lt;code&gt;%{&lt;/code&gt; and ends with &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; which is certaily not json yet) is piped through the &lt;code&gt;create_activity&lt;/code&gt; function and another &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; emerges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%{
  &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;,
  actor: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  cc: [],
  id: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/20a8f2d0-8f14-42bf-ab4f-c4d5a98c7c5a&quot;,
  object: %{
    # The article above
  },
  published: &quot;Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&quot;,
  to: [&quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;],
  type: &quot;Create&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I noted earlier, and also to prevent yourself from being beheaded a third time, make sure the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;em&gt;article&lt;/em&gt; (represented in the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;em&gt;create activity&lt;/em&gt;), the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;em&gt;create activity&lt;/em&gt; itself and the &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt; that goes into the &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; apparatus are &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; within thirty seconds of each other. Edit: The Ruby code I quoted above and which comes straight from the Mastodon source seems to think 12 hours is good enough. Regardless, playing it safe is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Identical to sending the &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; activity previously, this &lt;em&gt;create activity&lt;/em&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; follower’s inbox goes to &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt;. I loop through each inbox, calling &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly, and certainly realize this is not particularly efficient. I’ll get around to improving this and other laxnesses soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned near the beginning of this spiel, though, I could not get the &lt;em&gt;send to followers&lt;/em&gt; functionality of Activitypub to work. Therefore, instead of having &lt;code&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/followers&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cc&lt;/code&gt; fields, I directly add an array of the followers’ inboxes. The issue needs more investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, there you have it. I possibly missed a few steps and / or parts are misaligned and inexact. Having stated that caveat, I hope what I’ve written is of help to some of those &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; I keep hearing about who are ostensibly wandering around on the face of the planet. If so, said &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; should relax, celebrate, take some ketamine or whatever suits their fancy. I know I would were I a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; instead of a mere &lt;em&gt;mustelid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Artifact that Diluted a Species</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to #music, any piece that doesn’t contain an underlying current of melancholy or a smattering of anxiety isn’t ever going to be regarded as &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; in my inked book. I consider the two emotions the basis of quality art, or, translated into more humble terms, &lt;em&gt;art that appeals to the inner goat&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I quickly lose interest in pieces that ooze what some would call &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ecstasy&lt;/em&gt;. Their surface is too transparent. There is usually little beneath. Thus, &lt;em&gt;club&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt; music, in the modern sense, doesn’t appeal to me. In fact, it fills me with a rage that teeters on the edge of genocidal mania. As far as &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; goes, neither does folk music do much for &lt;em&gt;the inner goat&lt;/em&gt;. At times lyrics and melodies may pull on the hara’s firmament, but the inner emptiness of the music always overwhelms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An exception to the first paragraph is droning, mostly harmonically static, &lt;em&gt;ambient&lt;/em&gt; music. The deference to an emotionless morass is appealing to my cruder, Taoist sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My goal, apart from what I’ve typewritten with a hunk of dirt bashed against the skull of a goat, is to create &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt; music. Its relation to &lt;em&gt;droning, mostly harmonically static&lt;/em&gt; music is most apparent in that it is not defined by any emotion that I, its creator, am oozing during the moment of creation (or any other moments in its temporal vicinity). Any #emotion conjured from a piece is incidental, created by the ooze of chemicals within the listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I have hopes that the primary emotion that surges from an active or passive listener is unbridled &lt;strong&gt;RAGE&lt;/strong&gt;. They transform into their interior &lt;strong&gt;GOAT&lt;/strong&gt; and viciously butt passerbys into metaphorical &lt;em&gt;cunetas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ostensible connotation is that none of my music will be, by my former definition, &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; in my inked book. In that my satisfaction is more with the journey of creating than in the finished product, I’m not bothered. My &lt;em&gt;goat hara&lt;/em&gt; is complex enough and infused with enough modular history that I’m sure a mixture of varying emotional material will flow into a piece no matter my intention. I’ll be the “judge” of whether anything is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; later in life by the impressions the pieces leave on my later self.&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, I asked Christián for his opinion of the percussion in a short piece I’d written for Dani’s short film. At one point, he asked me, &lt;strong&gt;What are you trying to accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt; I made up some bullshit about a statue of the Buddha with a pistol on a beach on the Baltic Sea, waves lapping at its base. A module in my collective mind reacted before my more mature modules could stop it. It feared that without an initial #narrative to back the piece of music up, the whole process was meaningless. Even after other #modules caught up, I didn’t back up and correct myself. Only later in the evening did I write something pertaining to my more mature thoughts on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From far back in my cultural education, I was progressively etched. If there is no compelling narrative as the impetus for a piece of #music, then it has no substance. Why? Why can’t a piece of art stand on its own without a story to back it? I respect Abstract Expressionists in this regard. And, in fact, for myriad works I have completed and are in the process of completion, no underlying narrative exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of my modules carry this cultural etching. The ones that do not, or on which the etchings are fading, become more and more dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it is inevitable that for music humans bother to delve into, narratives are created, sourced from personal experiences and from emotions that surface during immersion. These pieces of art do not require an &lt;em&gt;initial&lt;/em&gt; narrative, though. No #meaning is necessary. They can be personal sounding boards. They can be spaces where reverberations create unique narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Every Contextual Greyness Fading from an Edge You Are</title>

What remains, in my mind, in the soundtrack to Dani’s newest short film, austerely entitled &lt;em&gt;Sheriff&lt;/em&gt;, is one more short piece. I’m not counting the two #SirAlfredIV remakes that still have to be done. Forcing Christián to sing &lt;em&gt;A House of Strength and Love&lt;/em&gt; will be a chore. Oh, he’ll sing it well and be willing, but he is anything but timely when collaborating on #music. His main problem, obviously, is that he has no access to Romanian Prostitutes in South Carolina (subsequently known as &lt;em&gt;The Pit&lt;/em&gt;). Being of the ignorant farmboy type, he’d not notice the &lt;em&gt;Guress Jewel&lt;/em&gt; inside each Romanian Prostitute, sense nothing of the underlying richness of &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; or its &lt;em&gt;regular expression syntax&lt;/em&gt;, and simply toss her to the dogs (or to his brother) after profaning her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actally, Christián &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Sheriff&lt;/em&gt; in Dani’s newest short #film. And a fine sheriff he is, untimely imp or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The latest piece and the remaining one are both based on melodies I wrote for &lt;em&gt;Insensetez&lt;/em&gt;, the July tune in my Jazz course. The melodies are wholly original, though other parts of my arrangement were based on the original melody of the piece. As I showered earlier, I put on &lt;em&gt;Rain Tree Crow&lt;/em&gt; at a volume that created an ambience, as it should be. In specific, &lt;strong&gt;New Moon at Red Deer Wallow&lt;/strong&gt; struck me as the sort of environment I’d like. The pace is hollow. The synth rolls like moonbeams made to dapple a forest floor in vaguely geometic abstractions. The melody itself drifts in and out almost as if it were peeking occasionlly around a stone but mostly keeping to itself. I’ll keep this all in mind for my recitation (as Robert Calvert would say, were he not dispersed into the roots of various vegetables).&lt;/p&gt;
