    <title>A Mundane, Tech-Oriented Entry</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/499.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/499.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
This morning, I was supine and reading various Gemini feeds. I cannot seem to find the one I want to refer to with this entry, however, as the space is still slightly disorganised. Probably I took sloum’s Spacewalk page as a starting point, found an article about Gemini feeds that inspired me to update my own Spacewalk instance, got up, sat at Tahr (the mighty desktop!) and simply could not find said article again. That sent me on a quest. The quest has been a failure, but I did find another fault in my own Gemini Server setup. My pages recently used to all terminate in &lt;em&gt;.gemini&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;.gmi&lt;/em&gt;. If I search in GUS for &lt;em&gt;lakife&lt;/em&gt;, for example, I get a series of pages on thurk.org that have the old extension. What must I do? I must teach Molly Brown to rewrite Gemini urls. I shall add that to today’s “bullet journal”. I laughingly call what I do by hand a “bullet journal”. Anyway, that’s another topic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I downloaded the Spacewalk software some time ago and added a collection of feeds that I could read through every few days - things of interest, not just technically, but in a sense of content itself. If Gemini-space remains wholly tech-oriented, even I would tire after some time. I have a systemd timer set up to re-launch (ie, update) my personal Spacewalk thrice a day. It’s a good enough start for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Metaphor for Listlessness</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/498.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/498.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
As the days creep towards the arbitrary division between one year and the next, I am somewhat culturally forced to think about a few things that I could pay more attention to in the upcoming cycle around our waning sun. I feel like I have grown apart from the “random”, or what I call in my personal shibboleth, and in the shibboleth that some close friend share, &lt;em&gt;Sweet Entropy&lt;/em&gt;. When aleatory ideas blow by on the breeze, I must catch them far more often than I do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I believe I used to catch these aleatory snatches more frequently, but one grows older - into decrepitude. One settles and becomes metaphorically sessile. The path to decrepitude is, ironically, sitting still, intellectually &lt;strong&gt;as well as physically&lt;/strong&gt;. This year’s quarantines have aged me slightly and I don’t like it one bit. Neither does Sweet Entropy, who is ever beckoning, normally subtly, but now with wild gesticulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I do believe I used to snatch these aleatory breezes more often. Sometimes it is as simple as just taking notice of the thought as it passes in that occluded module of the mind that forms most of the daily background noise. It’s the antithesis of concentration, but upon it also floats those aleatory snatches I need to reach out and grasp. Mostly, they appear as response to outside stimuli - a fly buzzing in the speaker cone, or a shred of carrot hurled from a food processor. Instead of ignoring them as oddities or passing phenomena, each can lead to interesting pathways and eventually to fecund groves. Capture um, stick um in a book of notes (digital or no), peruse um again and again, unite um with current creativity, and let um shunt a creative thread this-a-way or that-a-way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other words, follow threads that appear randomly throughout the day, or at least note them. Let fewer escape. Each one, no matter how disparate from an arbitrary unifying factor, can become part of the tapestry. Or - alternatively - buy a bottle of vodka, down it all, lie sessile in stupor, and ignore the passing breezes, aleatory or not. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I shall expunge more and more empty conversation from my life, as well. I realise that the concept of &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt; differs depending on whom you ask, and mine may be too strict for many, but since I’ll be lying in a drunken stupor for all of 2011, in any case, these words can be taken with a grain of cesium salt. Or - since my &lt;strong&gt;journaling music&lt;/strong&gt; this morning is &lt;em&gt;Weird Tapes 6&lt;/em&gt; by Hawkwind and the current track happens to be &lt;em&gt;Master of the Universe&lt;/em&gt;, I am reminded that I, in fact, am the master of the universe and therefore, whether I’m lying in a drunken stupor or not, all must heed my idea of &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt; and conform. Those who do not will be consigned to the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I shall expunge more and more empty conversation from my days. Most of what I term &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt; stems from mundane events that happen in the streets, the markets, in lunar orbit or even in the pit. One takes an event and uses it as impetus for a conversation, be it to pick up a chick at a hospoda in Nusle or pass time with a colleague whilst sucking down a bocadillo during a brief lunch between shifts in the ward. Such an impetus doesn’t have to become an &lt;em&gt;empty conversation&lt;/em&gt;, of course. It can be used as an aleatory idea snatched from the day’s breeze to symbolise something more profound in one’s thoughts, or as a haiku back and forth, or as a metaphor for another concern. What bothers me is that my experience has seen most of these impetuses solely become seed for a flurry of complaints about aspects of &lt;em&gt;the daily grind&lt;/em&gt;. They immediately mire themselves in a negative quicksand, pulling anyone involved into its depths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A bloke arrives at hospoda in Nusle after nearly being cut into three pieces by a speeding tramvaj. He begins a conversation with the aforementioned chick. It quickly spirals into a negative morass concerning the inhumanity of tramvaj drivers, the poor state of public transportation, the aimless, destructive arc of government and the heat death of the universe. Now, I don’t want to disparage the heat death of the universe, but the other three topics don’t strike me as constructive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not turn the event into a haiku writing marathon where each three line piece of brilliance details the different decorative configurations of head, torso and abdomen after being severed in three sections by a tramvaj? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not expound on the possible thoughts said driver was having during the lapse? Surely the driver was fantasising of sentient vegetative life in a symmetrical sphere in orbit around our moon, connected telepathically to other symmetrical spheres of sentient vegetative life orbiting the very same moon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not just skip to the end and discuss the heat death of the universe at length? Even at such length that one reaches the heat death of the universe! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Why not just circumvent the whole situation by lying listless at home in a drunken stupor?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Obsessive-compulsive Spurts</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
And December progresses. Blather is transcribed directly from neural circuitry to VIM. Tea steeped. I fetched it and imbibed it. All this is part of another morning in Logroño. Mornings in Logroño are, by now, a routine, or each morning routine is chosen from a selection of those I have at hand. The only consistent facet in the selection of routines is the tea. All praise Tea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, &lt;em&gt;writing&lt;/em&gt;, which is part of a number of the aforementioned routines, gives me a sensation of accomplishment. Other facets also do, even including Tea, but writing more than any of the rest. The sense of accomplishment fosters peace and this sense of “accomplishment” is the act itself. The content, in the end, doesn’t matter much. I recall the turbulent April of 2000. I was alone in my hotel room in München. Malaise had crept into my days. I felt it tangibly like a film coating my skin. I whipped out the old “Woodnotes” journal (sadly lost forever in the bowels of Aleksandra) and added a few pages to the end. Or perhaps it was in the leather bound journal (a gift from Brynn) that I still have. It is stationed in the bookshelf behind me. Whichever of the two journals it was, writing in it calmed me. That calm emanated from having a sense of purpose. What sense of purpose was that? The writing itself? Sure. It was ethereal, a sensation. The film evaporated from my skin. My chemicals churned differently simply because I placed words on a page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I bought the Woodnotes journal at a bookstore when I was living in Austin in 1995 or 1996, I &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt;. My memory’s mottled film shows me a few frames of Craig commenting on the journal, so it may have been before that. 1994? Maybe, but I don’t have any recollection of having it during my “outing” with Melanie. So I retract that. It had to be spring of 1996. A year before, I filled a spiral notebook with jabber. In fact, that very spiral notebook is sitting to the right of my keyboard. I need to finish transcribing it. Those were the days of the University of Houston in Clear Lake and of Marcie. Poor Marcie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In any case, simply having these journals calmed my mind and writing in them, even more, including if the result of said writing was nothing to, er, write home about. I believe it was a form of meditation. I gave up on “real” meditation after a bout with it during the spiral notebook spring. So I was left with writing. And although I am not really a victim of anxiety in general, I think that at least the beginnings of that demonic sensation creep up on me when I &lt;strong&gt;haven’t&lt;/strong&gt; written in a while. Just another reason to keep stream-of-conciousness writing frequent in the morning routine. Words are moderators of the hara and diffusers of the spirit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And believe me, spirits need to be diffuse. Density is not a pretty personality trait, especially for a spirit. Dense spirits tend to pile at the bottom of the cosmic cistern. They become clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Messages from Kris on Mastodon yesterday detailed the difference between approaches in Flavigula music and Youstuva music. The latter is a fusionish project he’s been working with for longer than I’ve known him. He wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
When working on your material, it is very Melodically/Harmonically complex compared to playing bass with Youstuva. For my parts, Youstuva tends to be more focused on rhythm. (Time signature changes/polymeters/polyrhythms.) Not that your material doesn’t have those aspects as well but it’s a different take on the same aspects for both. (If that makes sense.) That’s one of the reason I love doing multiple projects.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
He’s a very versatile player as the two projects are sonically incredibly different. I suppose one could say they are both vaguely steeped in a Jazz / Progressive Rock soup, Youstuva much more than Flavigula, but that’s where the similarity ends. That reminds me that I should listen to Youstuva today. It’s been a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been exchanging email with Kris concerning &lt;em&gt;Nolju Tafiz&lt;/em&gt; (The Second Instant), formerly titled &lt;em&gt;Sas Tafiz&lt;/em&gt; (The Second Breath - though the meaning was originally the same, the word &lt;em&gt;sas&lt;/em&gt; experienced semantic drift). In my notes that I’m referring to as I type this, I state that the “album” is mostly done. That is untrue. The album (which will end with &lt;em&gt;Nolju Tafiz&lt;/em&gt;) is very far from done, even in the composing department. At the time, I thought I’d just cobble together the tracks I had as demos and titled collectively &lt;em&gt;A Cupboard of Moors&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Bricked-up Cupboard&lt;/em&gt;, revise them slightly and have a coherent musical statement. Instead, the revising has become a meticulous recomposing process. It’s marvellously enjoyable. You should try it. It will bring diffusion to your clunky spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Nolju Tafiz&lt;/em&gt; and another piece bookend the pieces I am revamping, congealing them into a type of suite. These bookends will feature Christian’s vocals, if he ever gets around to it. Otherwise, they’ll feature extended kalimba solos that are unrelated to the rest of the musical content. I suspect Christian’s “tardiness” in his Flavigula tasks is a combination of slight loss of interest (after all, Flavigula is no longer a fresh concept) and a life in South Carolina that is littered with family commitments, lettuce preparation / cultivation, house remodelling, hag and escort impregnation, and spending hours every morning and evening watching Youtube. His desire and effort to learn FL Studio (or any DAW at all) is impressive, though. The tenuous void around space-time quivers with the harmonic content he eructs from such experiments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There Is No Discussion Of Geese In This Entry</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/496.gmi</id>

Of course, the tea has steeped and has been ready for consumption for some minutes now. To be completely honest, I’ve already consumed two cups. In contrast to yesterday (or yesteryear, for those of you in the throes of severe time dilation from marijuana or other assorted psychedelics), I’ll be drinking &lt;em&gt;English Breakfast&lt;/em&gt; today. It’s wondrous bitter tinge overtakes whichever metaphorical warmth I’m feeling at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In my musings from over a month ago now, which were meant as the raw material for the blog entries that now sit lacklustre in MongoDb, waiting to be served on either a Gemini or Http platter, I continued my thread of thought concerning concentration. I wrote this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The theme for the past week has been thought dispersion. I’m having problems concentrating even now. Possibly, this is because I just looked at the word count of this thurk and found it was ~100 shy of my daily goal. This, in itself, is rather unproductive. Instead of being in the writing, my mind is looking at the &lt;em&gt;end&lt;/em&gt; of the session, to whatever comes next. Living in this moment becomes harder when the mind goes into a holistic jaunt concerning the hours or whole day surrounding the moment. The moment is a &lt;strong&gt;pinpoint&lt;/strong&gt;, or, as we say in Lakife, &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt; that is immeasurable in its tininess. It moves along the plane of time. I inhabit that tininess, but my mind wants to float above and contemplate the whole plane. There are advantages to both ways of thought, but during a writing session, &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt; is where I want to be. &lt;em&gt;Et mitin af tyk nis&lt;/em&gt;. I want to be inside the point, the dot, the atom. It is the point of the blade that etches. The mind that controls that blade has sensory apparatus uniquely at that point and nowhere else.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m listening to an ostensible improvisation by Jayrope’s &lt;em&gt;Air Cushion Finish&lt;/em&gt; project. If you’ve ever heard anything by this project, you’d know that it distracts the concentrated mind. It, itself, demands concentration. Thus, I’m doing the exact opposite at this moment that my previous goal stated. I’m dividing my attention. Perhaps in this &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt;, I’m resigned to that fate. And during this subsequent &lt;em&gt;tyk&lt;/em&gt;, as well. &lt;em&gt;Nolju&lt;/em&gt; is instant. Though another term might do, as well - &lt;em&gt;tyk noliz&lt;/em&gt;. An atom, or seed, or singularity of time. Same idea, though different metaphor. As the book I’m currently reading constantly states - we are the metaphors we inhabit. That again reminds me of Vonnegut, though he’s not the author I’m currently reading, and also passes my mind back to an entry from a few days ago when I also mentioned Vonnegut. Ah, but my concentration drifts. Or am I riding the blade on a stream of conciousness wave? Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I drift now back to my notes from early November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I had just published &lt;em&gt;Songs for Looptober&lt;/em&gt; (nine minutes before, according to said notes) and had begun listening to it, as I’m wont to do immediately after a publication. It begins with Christian claiming &lt;em&gt;That’s because you’re a bad person, vole.&lt;/em&gt; Whether this is true or not is up for debate and has been for decades, centuries even. I’ll quote the rest. (Note - I was listening to &lt;em&gt;Pôle&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Besombes &amp; Rizet&lt;/em&gt; immediately before putting on the Flavigula album.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The first thing that strikes me is the loss of a bit of volume switching from &lt;em&gt;Besombes &amp; Rizet&lt;/em&gt; to the new Flavigula. Over the last few days, I’ve remastered the tracks, trying to let the max volumes hover between -11 and -12 LUFS. Possibly this is not enough. I want the compositions to breathe, however, having dynamics. The key may be not to just jam up the limiter, but carefully adjust each of the tracks’ volume to stay below a peak of -6db (headroom, ya know?), but to interact organically. All this before the limiter. I’m still an infant when it comes to the mixing and mastering process, I feel. And infants are only good for one thing - to be eaten. As Acy once said: &lt;em&gt;Babies are high in protein&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve since ended the mastering process by using ffmpeg (and its associated &lt;em&gt;loudnorm&lt;/em&gt;) to normalise the track to -16 LUFS and somewhere between 12 and 16 LRA (loudness range) depending on the dynamics of the piece. This strategy has proven successful so far, or at least no one has made any comments regarding my mastering, though I wish they would, positive or negative. What are music communities for, if not that? Eh? On the piece recently (two days ago) finished for Quentin for today’s TwitchTV stream, I also wanted to add a touch of convolution reverb. Adding it before the normalisation process, however, resulted in muddiness. The muddiness was slight - a mere smear of filth on a thin, plastic plate, perhaps - but enough to make me remove the reverb. Adding the impulse response after normalization would be ideal, but the process’d be too convoluted (pun intended). Or, alternatively, my lethargy may defeat the process before it begins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I’m on the subject of sound design, I’ll blather a bit on the subject of Supercollider. My relationship with the system is tremulous. One grey, protruding half of my personality loves programming and programming for sound design seems &lt;strong&gt;ideal&lt;/strong&gt;. The other grey, protruding half sees it as a mostly grueling routine that sucks away much more time than I’d like for it to. This complaint centers around the “programming” / “practising music” dichotomy. It’s a dichotomy that only exists, obviously, in my mind. Even wiring together patches on SBUP is a type of programming. All of this takes away from time I have my Telecaster cradled in my lap. So, in this querulous module of my mind, “programming for sound design” is lumped in with “programming in general”. The disillusionment arrives when something I bash out in Supercollider doesn’t sound remotely like what I had in my head. Usually this doesn’t bother me when I’m experimenting on “real” instruments, but with, for example, Supercollider, it’s &lt;strong&gt;programming&lt;/strong&gt;. The machine should do as I say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yes, I realise that I must simply learn to speak the language better. Bastard machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In other news, my restlessness is piquing. I haven’t had the chance to have a “vacation” or trip to Praha since September. Am I stir crazy? No - I just need to feel that for some time there is NO ONE I need to answer to for anything. This is a difficult state to achieve when you live with someone. Someones are demanding. I am destined to live alone again. It’ll come sooner than I think. In fact, the knife’s edge of time, carried on an accelerating wave, speeds towards that very moment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Translucent Backdroop of the Age</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/495.gmi</id>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I recently realised that I didn’t have a copy of Peter Hammill’s &lt;em&gt;X My Heart&lt;/em&gt;. I quickly remedied the atrocity and then listened to said album. I find it glorious. It was released around 1998, around a time of great change for me. The song &lt;em&gt;A Better Time&lt;/em&gt; was on some compilation or other that I was listening to in those days. Such compilations were one way to discover new music, just as hanging out on Mastodon is today, though slightly less dynamic. The “gap” in my psyche that not having this album produced brought about a sentimentality I didn’t know I had for those days. That’d be the “pre-leaving-Brynn” period, of course, not the “I escaped from a hellish marriage then spent a month doing insane things with Mr Bender then found myself in a huge, empty flat in Praha” period. In any case, the “gap” in my cerebral draining pit that not having this album produced spawned a sentimentality I didn’t know I had for those days. That sentimentality was short lived, though, as the last time I clearly remembered listening to the actual CD was either in the Petra Rezka flat, most of the furniture gone, one of my last days there. Or, alternatively, a few months later in Jeníček’s flat during my visit over Xmas 2000. That CD might have ended up with Aleksandra and is therefore lost forever. Bastard me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In the notes I am revising for this blog entry, I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Today, the third Noisevember cut begins. The starting point are the four tones - Ab G E C#. I will implement a crude granular synthesis of my guitar playing these tones in various octaves. I still consider myself a Supercollider amateur, but I know enough to cut up samples into buffers and then play the buffers in sequence with gaps between them. This should create granular note after granular note. Perhaps I should have them actually played in random order, or in fact, harmonized in random order. A linear counter point of two. I like this idea. I’ll go with it as the backdroop. The BACKDROOP. The thing that hangs in the grey landscape behind all things. The backdroop. The prominence that is not prominent but always there. The hunk of flesh lolling from the sky. The uvula of deities. Fuck um. The tea must be steeped by now.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The tea is indeed steeped by now. I shall fetch a mug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am now listening to the resultant track, &lt;em&gt;Tyk Jena Tin Nulu&lt;/em&gt; (Solitary Seed in the Void) in all its mixed and mastered glory. It’s very sparse, as I set out for it to be, and the four notes are respected, for the most part. They are distributed throughout the track in spurts by guitar, ukulele, Boris (the Korg Minilogue), etc. A C# drone ebbs in the backdroop, ever-present. Perhaps, in honour of this particular backdroop, I should have &lt;em&gt;C#&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;cis&lt;/em&gt; tattooed on my uvula. It’s not like I’m using my uvula for anything else. It might as well become a decorative object. In any case (the connective of the day), I am now listening to the resultant track, &lt;em&gt;Tyk Jena Tin Nulu&lt;/em&gt;, for the second time. Even after scarcely more than a month, I wouldn’t know the granules are necessarily sampled electric guitar. Happily, I did not insist they continued throughout the whole piece, but only ebbed in and out of silence when they were “necessary”. Apart from the backdroop, nothing walks the sonic landscape constantly. Ideas hop from discrete point to discrete point. To me, the resultant mood is successful precisely because of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think during my epoch of daily improvisation, I did not realise that parts that ebb in and out of a landscape create a better overall sonic painting. They serve better than broad, constant strokes of the guitar or synth brush. When sparsity did take priority over creating layers, it was accidental. I hope I’ve learned my lesson. Perhaps this is a factor that contributes to my idea that most “solos” in music are failures. Usually, the soloist wants to paint a bright stroke over a canvas that calls complete attention to itself when the narcissist asshole would better serve the piece with a middle ground between said swath and a type of discrete pointillism. Of course, soloists and improvisers alike tend to get lost in a moment, forgetting their environment. They will be consigned to the pit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Returning to the nostalgia of 1998, or, in this case, 1997, the music I chose for today’s writing adventure was the first album by Lard Free. Its first track, &lt;em&gt;Warinobaril&lt;/em&gt;, was also on a compilation I was listening to during the initial months of the failed, hellish marriage. That compilation, titled &lt;em&gt;Supernatural Fairy Tales&lt;/em&gt;, provided impetus to explore quite a bit of music unknown to me at the time. With Lard Free, I’m sitting on the floor of our basement apartment on Dexter Avenue (I believe that was the name of the street) in Capitol Hill in Seattle, drinking in this music. I didn’t hear the entire album that contains &lt;em&gt;Warinobaril&lt;/em&gt; until years later, living in Praha, lost in my decade of personal haze.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Connectives Are for the Weak</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I have lost the thread. I am certainly out of practise, writing-wise. This is true even if I’ve been more or less consistent over the last month and a half. Or so I tell myself! I sit down and I find myself in a state of pause more than in any other state. The flying fingers of yesteryear are but nostalgia! Oh, woe! Fuck um. Similarly, my fingers stumble after being away in Praha for a week and I begin fumbling at the guitar again. Most past routines, once abandoned, reassemble themselves, perhaps not in the “ideal” form, but in some form or another. One moment, connectives do not exist. Sentences plod shambling one after another. Then, glue arrives from linguistic wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connectives is a topic that “frightens” me in every language. They are the easiest to use clunkily. They are the easiest to use ephemerally. Or, rather, it’s easy to fall back on them when searching for a “proper” construction in which to place one’s thoughts. I see this phenomenon especially with people who only study a language up to a certain point, then proceed to “wing it” during the rest of their shambling, disconnected lives. I’ve been in those shoes from time to time. Certainly, it’s better to be cognizant of one’s linguistic constructions even if you are a native speaker. It allows one to avoid to falling into the “empty words” pit. It’s like… I mean… yeah… you know. Pravě. Peasants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connectives is a topic that “frightens” me in every language. And, to illustrate my fright, I haven’t explored the topic much in Lakife. I’m in the process, but it’s a slog. Subordinate clauses also fall within the realm of linguistic horrors. I realised last night whilst naming the new Flavigula piece that the use of a subordinate clause, required in this case, is ambiguous (and possibly ill-conceived). I’ll elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hapa fela liz li min nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; == The fire of creeping (or crawling) joy. Whereas in English, one can simply qualify &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;creeping&lt;/em&gt;, Lakife’s current grammar insists on a subordinate clause. The main clause &lt;em&gt;hapa fela liz&lt;/em&gt; is simply “fire joy GENITIVE-PARTICLE” and could also be stated &lt;em&gt;joy’s fire&lt;/em&gt;. A subordinate clause that modifies the closest noun phrase starts with &lt;em&gt;li&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;em&gt;li nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; (which means “THAT along-the-ground moving”) could refer to &lt;em&gt;hapa&lt;/em&gt; (fire) or to &lt;em&gt;fela&lt;/em&gt; (joy). I invented a new connective particle - &lt;em&gt;limin&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;li min&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps - that indicates that the subject of the subordinate clause is the closest genitive. So, &lt;em&gt;hapa fela liz li min nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; would be, literally, (the) fire of joy that (the) joy creeps. I like it, and it reminds me a bit of Toki Pona structurally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the phrase &lt;em&gt;li nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; is used enough, it could reasonably be compressed into a single adjective. It happens as languages evolve, and if you don’t believe me, you can consult Lyle Campbell’s &lt;em&gt;Historical Linguistics&lt;/em&gt;. You have it over there on your nightstand. It’s not just decoration. Read it. So, compression - reasonably, &lt;em&gt;li nutzen mija&lt;/em&gt; could be compressed to &lt;em&gt;nutzenja&lt;/em&gt;, which would simply be “activity along the ground”. Hrm. I like that. This would simplify the title, as well - &lt;em&gt;hapa fela liz nutzenja&lt;/em&gt;. If you wanted to make the fire creep along the ground, instead, you’d state &lt;em&gt;hapa nutzenja fela liz&lt;/em&gt;. Joy’s creeping fire. Now that I consider it, I like that title better. Funny how pondering something moulds it. Bastard brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Voy a retroceder un poco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Connectives is a topic that “frightens” me in every language. It’s one that I have mastered in no language - not even in my native language. I purposely leave out connectives. My sentences rest on their own. The flow is implied. Chords connecting phrases are only in the mind of the reader. The style reminds me of Vonnegut, vaguely. It also reminds me of how I sometimes write music, and of some music that I immensely enjoy. I create a patchwork of modal colours, sewn together. The thread binding them place them side by side, and the thread’s colour is itself vague, an unclear indigo grey. Traditional harmonic movement is usually not part of my agenda. Like traditional harmonic movement, it’s important for me that the thread, no matter how vaguely hued, &lt;strong&gt;does&lt;/strong&gt; exist. The connective tissue can be a single phrase, even a single note, or lack of phrase, or even lack of a single note - something implied. However, I do find myself pondering vi bII i cadences frequently. Ah ha! My assholery has been revealed. I used a connective two sentences ago! I should be tortured for my lack of consistency. The weed that is my core neural binding should be ripped from its metaphorical earth. That reminds me that I wanted to explore tertiary dominants, or a similar concept not using necessarily dominants.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coffee Cups Made From The Skulls Of Marketing Men</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/492.gmi</id>

Speaking of James -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Well, that is an odd way to start a blog entry, isn’t it? &lt;em&gt;Speaking of James -&lt;/em&gt; has no context. Actually, considering that I do look back over old entries from time to time, given my writing history, it’s not a very odd way to start a blog entry at all. So, I’ll begin again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of James - and possibly drifting into &lt;em&gt;quejica&lt;/em&gt; mode - he is wandering more and more often into the sea of marketing. I do understand why, naturally, and don’t necessarily blame him, though that doesn’t mean I won’t make a coffee cup or tea mug or other receptacle from his cranium. He’s spent the last two years involved more with getting &lt;em&gt;what we do&lt;/em&gt; out and into the eyes of prospective clientele. This is in contrast to doing development, which is my principal role. He is wandering more and more often into the undulating waters of marketing, submerged in a mentality that I’ve been trying to escape since before my birth. For example, he frequently asks for architectural changes that he declares must be &lt;em&gt;simple&lt;/em&gt;. He has lost perspective on the time it takes to morph and debug code. The marketing mentality is a curse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I pine for simple days when I sat around plunking in programs that burped forth absurdities to entertain myself and my friends. Those days are mostly gone. But there is Gemini. Gemini is good. Perhaps I’ll see a resurgence of the spirit of those simple days. Perhaps I’ve already seen its beginnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking no longer of James -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some dude that I met at RIO last year plucks away at an acoustic guitar or some other such acoustic instrument. The results flow from my near-field monitors and buffet against my tympani. The music has a quaint British folk quality that used to entice me but now does almost nothing for me. Renata, the spirits of the netherworld take her soul, still follows a similar path. Perhaps my tastes in music are narrowing. Is it a factor of decrepitude? Surely, it is a factor of other narrowings I’ve consciously performed in the last few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve made it a point to &lt;strong&gt;try&lt;/strong&gt; to cut out parts of my life that I find distract too much from the &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; tasks. What are the important tasks, the mustelid in the corner asks? Well, making music, for one. I’m pretty satisfied with my results concerning that. In fact, I probably spend more time on practising and / or composing or recording music than anything else summed. Writing is another &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt; task, though I’ve only recently taken it up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The sensory dispersal of common life takes its toll on me no matter my narrowing goals. As much as I try to ignore it, I’m also a “victim” of social media idleness. I’ve eliminated most everything except for Mastodon, but I still take a look at Facebook occasionally because there are still stubborn souls there who REFUSE to migrate to anywhere else. I pity them. Perhaps I should make coffee cups or tea mugs from their skulls. That way, I could abandon Facebook altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to think that megalomaniacal entity could be useful for “marketing” Flavigula music, in the sense that more people could know about it by some sort of promotional (marketing) magic. I initially considered it a test. Now I consider the test done. Though there are various ambient and electronic groups on said megalomaniacal entity that I’ll comment to when Flavigula has a new release, I’m done with megalomaniacal magic marketing systems. I’ve seen no noticeable results. Word of mouth, Mastodon, flavigula.net and thurk.org gemini suffice. Oh, and Submarine Broadcasting when and if I submit future “main sequence” albums to them. They can market um up if they wish. I consider that part out of my hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyhow, again, the sensory dispersal of common life takes its toll on me no matter my narrowing goals. I’m not exactly angered, as I don’t commonly experience that emotion, but frustrated. Or perhaps the emotion is a gradient flowing between frustration and resignation. Part of it comes from being in a relationship and having to spend time every evening watching television with Marisa. Not everything we watch is drivel, and some films / series that we choose pique my imagination, but for the most part it’s a waste of my time. For her, it’s mindless downtime after dealing with children all day at work and dealing with stress-oozing family matters via telephone at home. And I understand the need for this. However, consequently, she usually doesn’t want to watch something intellectually stimulating. Over the months, there have been trends of shows concerning lawyers, political uprising, getting one’s head bashed in with a lead pipe, herds of goats lecturing on script writing for the masses, and the fertility of Spanish ogres. With all that in mind, my opinion is that movies, shows, books and tales about trials, courtrooms and the social lives of lawyers and lawyer types can marinate in a tub of feces. I dig a good detective flick, though. Those are different beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mélange</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Today is the first day in a few epochs that I’ve awoke without a headache, however slight. My final conclusion is carbohydrate intake within a certain number hours before going to sleep and slowing my metabolism. My main crime is eating something in bed before retiring. Pistachios are culpable. They will be banished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday’s experiment, which I shall repeat today, that resulted in a morning without a dull, cerebral ache, involved having NOTHING to eat at all after approximately 15.40 except for the lassi I made in the evening. Strangely, the lassi included honey and I was not affected. This leads me to believe that sugar itself is not a culprit. Further tests are needed. And the lassi was delicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m in the throes of mixing and mastering the new Noisevember album. Unlike last year’s adventure, I consider this year’s musical journey a substantial album. It jerks. It burbles. It trickles. It undulates. I think the pieces are worthy of something other than naming it just another month-long sonic experiment. I’m leaving the final title up to a narcissist asshole, however, so it’s possible I’ll be punished for the sheer fondness I have of my musical adventure’s results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The original concept was to attempt to complete a piece within every two days. Since the result came to 15 tracks, I’d say I was successful here. The second concept, one that I only followed for the first third or so of the month, was that each “miniature” was based on a series of between three and five notes randomly chosen by a Bash script I wrote whilst sitting in the passenger’s seat of Marisa’s car on the way back from our small getaway to Agoncillo. Agoncillo is a small, frightening village in the deserty mini-mountains of south-east La Rioja. You are not required to visit. In fact, you are prohibited from visiting. The coffee is awful and there is not a single mustelid in sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyhow, the original concept was to write “miniatures” based on a series of between three and five notes randomly chosen by a Bash script. I subconsciously abandoned that idea after running through the groups of notes I’d generated during the aforementioned journey. To me, there is a stark harmonic contrast between the pieces that began as such and the later ones, composed from whatever my hara eructed at inception. I’ve shuffled the playlist a bit, so anyone trying to discern which track started with which compositional method could be flummoxed and in their flummoxed state find me and bludgeon me with a small length of lead pipe. I won’t blame them. In fact, the bludgeoning(s) can serve as inspiration for further experimental material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
After starting the first piece, epochs or a month ago, I wrote the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
I began the first piece yesterday. It starts with a bang - a bang from the dust from the Plaits, crumbling quickly into particle matter. I will create minimal drones that interact harmonically and spatially over a few minutes. They will act more as a backdrop than anything else. Spooky resonances will bubble! Moderate or even sparse “melodies” will pepper the drones! The aforementioned notes will form these melodies. Will they be true “melodies”? Of course. Even two notes repeated endlessly is a melody.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And furthermore:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The only concern I have is the new VCO I have. I abandoned the 2hp VCO for this Złob dual VCO which is so far not satisfactory. It just doesn’t play well with my filters. Of course, before abandoning it, I shall put it through the rigors of being a part of Shambal Brambel’s Undulating Platypus. Or was it “ululating”? Only the deity that sits sessile on a (mostly) abandoned moon circling an anonymous gas giant in an unnamed solar system would be able to say. Let’s ask him. Let’s not wait for a response.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Herr Złob VCO has received much use, in fact. I’ve had success modulating one of the oscillators with the other. Well, not directly, because that’s not possible, but by tossing the signal into the WMD/SSF MMF and having the other oscillator modulate the cutoff frequency. The resulting frequency modulation can be used for delightful percussion sounds and nefarious drones. Also, its triangle wave does great LPG bongos. Herr Złob VCO will remain in my toolbox for an epoch or two.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Let It Reign</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I have an empty cup that used to contain tea sitting before me. It was Earl Grey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The confusion before the word / preposition &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; is astounding. Before it irks me further, I’ll expound, as it was fucking with my development of &lt;em&gt;Lakife&lt;/em&gt;. In English, &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; can mean temporally in the immediate past of whatever temporal theme is being discussed. It can also mean &lt;em&gt;spatially&lt;/em&gt; immediately to the front. This ambiguity is not amusing to me. It is an abomination. My solution for Lakife is to clarify the difference for myself and for the table of pre- post- positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Originally, the table had the &lt;em&gt;spatial before&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;temporal before&lt;/em&gt; in the same row, associated with the preposition &lt;em&gt;tin&lt;/em&gt;. When I first began the design of the language, much of the work was done on 20+ hour bus rides around the southwest part of Australia. Possibly I was hungover during part of that time. Excuses aside, Lakife’s &lt;em&gt;fur&lt;/em&gt;  signifies &lt;strong&gt;before&lt;/strong&gt;, in the literal aspect. Spatially, the English equivalent is &lt;strong&gt;behind&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Fur … pot&lt;/em&gt; is the temporal version and &lt;em&gt;fur … nis&lt;/em&gt; is the spacial version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Etjo tex anja liz fur noz sopen pot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I will eat her child before nightfall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since &lt;em&gt;noz sopen&lt;/em&gt; (nightfall) already indicates time, the &lt;em&gt;pot&lt;/em&gt; at the end there is optional. I suppose &lt;em&gt;behind nightfall&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;towards the back of nightfall&lt;/em&gt; could be useful metaphoric or poetic concepts, but I’m sure you get what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Solan qotzifur neimolja tel topen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They went towards the back of the boat. Nothing surrealistic in this one. I apologize if you were expecting otherwise. On the other trembling paw, expectations are poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Topen&lt;/em&gt; possibly is not required, either, since movement is obvious by verbalizing &lt;em&gt;fur&lt;/em&gt; (with &lt;em&gt;qotzi&lt;/em&gt;, which indicates past tense, perfect aspect, vole).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Similarly, &lt;em&gt;potom&lt;/em&gt;, just like in Czech, indicates something that comes after something else temporally. In Lakife, it also indicates &lt;strong&gt;to the front&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;in the front&lt;/strong&gt; spatially. I’m sure that toots the muffin of the universe. As it should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ambiguity in language is useful for poetry and quirky prose. It’s also useful for one of my most hated things - puns. Though I’m trying to create grammar that is very delineated in Lakife, quirks of vocabulary and derivation will surely make ambiguity reign. Ambiguity should reign. Let our queen by Sweet Entropy. She is an androgynous “queen”. We’ll simply use the pronoun &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; to refer to her / it, as it has no gender. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve always been of the opinion that gender in language enforces gender roles and stereotypes in a culture. The machismo of Spain and the festering bowels of Latin America seems to support my view. I’m aware that linguistic gender possibly arose from actual roles that men and women played in society back in what a narcissist asshole would call &lt;em&gt;the good ol days&lt;/em&gt;. Since I am unflinchingly progressive, I say &lt;strong&gt;fuck um&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;em&gt;the good ol days&lt;/em&gt; and so-called natural roles of anyone. Let’s shatter traditions, habits and long standing prejudices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like Estonian, Lakife doesn’t really have gender. Certainly, there are no gender markers on nouns nor adjectives. Add &lt;em&gt;-ju&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;-ja&lt;/em&gt; to the pronoun &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; to create “he” or “she” respectively, for convenience. However, those suffixes have very different meanings in other contexts, which is another break from gender roles. Specifically, &lt;em&gt;-a&lt;/em&gt; (and sometimes &lt;em&gt;-ja&lt;/em&gt;) shows an active state of an idea or entity whilst &lt;em&gt;-u&lt;/em&gt; (and sometimes &lt;em&gt;-ju&lt;/em&gt;) indicates a passive or resting state. These are not my personal commentaries on the roles of female and male. No. It just happened as such, as sometimes the development of Lakife feels out of my hands. I set many rules in place and continue to do so, and given those rules as, um, let’s say &lt;strong&gt;axioms&lt;/strong&gt;, the whole system grows. It is, in a sense, generative.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Oblivious Rule the Earth</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
What I have come to think of as the &lt;em&gt;oblivious nature of the Spanish&lt;/em&gt; or simply the &lt;em&gt;Spanish behaviour&lt;/em&gt;, just occurred outside my apartment, in the stub of a corridor, in front and partially inside of the lift. That last bit is very important. Our new neighbour, whose name is Juanco or somesuch, stood in the stub of the corridor speaking to another human who stood partially in and partially out of the lift. This latter human was therefore blocking the lift and preventing anyone else in the building from using it. The conversation carried on for at least ten minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since living in Logroño, I’ve noticed this type of behaviour in locals in general, and especially when it comes to the less than elegant process of saying “goodbye” to someone or a group of someones. An impromptu congregation manifests and seals itself inside a bubble. This frighteningly localised bubble does not admit any stimuli from beyond its membrane. A tendency also exists, when in a more public place, for this bubble to block or divert any pedestrian traffic in its proximity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m aware that this behaviour exists in places other than Spain, but its existence has announced itself much more strongly in this country than in any other in which I’ve lived. I’m also aware that in my decrepitude I may becoming more easily irked by the ways of the masses. Enough of caveats, though. These actions are empty of empathy, show a lack of observation skills, and promote general bubble-thinking. My rage only intensifies when these denizens put on the mask of joy or drink and the excuse of &lt;em&gt;fiesta&lt;/em&gt; to excuse themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They need to die.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Suspended Ambiguity May Get Over Itself Now</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/488.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/488.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of Michael Achenbach, I should attempt to look him up. My first question to him will be &lt;em&gt;Did you ever get around to making your own music?&lt;/em&gt; He was the &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; type, musically, though he studied to be a mechanical or electrical or some other sort of engineer. He’d pick up a stringed instrument and it just made sense to him. Though, admittedly, I did hear him spending long hours practising in his disheveled hovel-room in the Enfield house. &lt;em&gt;Intuitive&lt;/em&gt; contrasts with &lt;strong&gt;me&lt;/strong&gt;, one who struggles with every phrase. Or, I could say that I am musically intuitive but not mechanically intuitive. I’m certainly intuitive with abstractions, and music appears in my mind as an abstract force. The truth sits somewhere in the vague middle, as always. Fucking axis thinking. Fuck you, Brian Eno. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Music is a process borne on wings of intellect but accelerated by emotive force - and the resultant vector is what I call the &lt;strong&gt;hara&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I finished the mixing and mastering of the tenth Noisevember this morning. A disappointment that runs in tandem with these “compositional” challenges is that it seems that the participants are more concerned with timbre and sonic variety than harmonic studies. This goes for the narcissist asshole who is my “partner” in diabolic deeds, as well. So, what happened to interest in harmonic diversity, or should I not be surprised in this case since the “challenge” is entitled &lt;em&gt;Noisevember&lt;/em&gt;? Whether I’m surprised or not, I muse once again: &lt;em&gt;What happened to interest in harmonic diversity&lt;/em&gt;? What I hear is incredibly creative in the timbral universe, and I do admit that timbral composition can be amazing. What I also hear is the recycling of suspended chord patterns and minor drones in the harmonic sphere. Melody, when even apparent in this realm of music, waddles along the same cadence paths as usual since baroque times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems harmonic complexity reached an apex mid-20th century, plateaued and then fell into a gradual decrescendo. Pockets of creativity still exist. Hey, there’s Flavigula, for example! And I am always drawn towards those pockets and they exert powerful influence over my creativity. Run of the mill suspended chord patterns need to DIE. Or at least I really don’t need to hear them dribbling from every “experimentalist”‘s corner shop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slaves to Absurd Future Remembrance</title>

A stalk of bamboo hovers over me in eternal vigil. Eternity is the span of its existence, of course. Isn’t &lt;em&gt;eternity&lt;/em&gt; the span of any &lt;em&gt;entity’s&lt;/em&gt; existence? Does it take eternity to pass from the burp from the womb into the sudden state of decomposition? Does it take an eternity to pass from a smooth seed cradled in sod into the sudden state of decomposition? The span of life, this &lt;em&gt;eternity&lt;/em&gt;, passes in a flash. Every detail of its presence evaporates. He / she / it who perceived the passage no longer exists. So why my moaning about paying attention to each nuance in the wrinkles that form my day? When my conciousness decomposes or passes on or finally gets to hang out in that vast, yawning gulf between the walls of the edifice in which I live, surely my memories will pass with it. But even when I’m living in my mini-yurt in Mongolia and the only thing of note I do is play cribbage with Jeremy every few days, I’ll be able to pour through the collected details of my life and thus be in a state of evolution. Life itself is a composition. And compositions should always refer back to themselves. Otherwise, they are just a string of loosely connected riffs, themes, melodies and syncopations. Whether or not someone gets to experience the composition that is my life secondhand doesn’t matter. Fuck um. It’s the composing itself that toots my muffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following that thread, at times I do muse about death. It’s a comfort. Upon this passage, I will no longer be dragged behind the will to be creative, or the will to do anything, really. A relief! A breath! There will not be competition, cooperation, absurd ambition or anything at all. When death comes, I’ll have time to sit around and listen to and read all this &lt;em&gt;hovno&lt;/em&gt; I’ve stirred up from the mud of my lower mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also speaking of death, I continue to take &lt;strong&gt;freezing&lt;/strong&gt; showers to spur my telomeres into action! I will live forever! Actually, I’ve come to like the &lt;strong&gt;freezing&lt;/strong&gt; showers. They awaken not only my telomeres, but send me fresh into my studio to dream up more noise, be it sonic or typewritten. From time to time, I also do work that relates to mine and James’s project, but don’t tell the Dean of Creative Science that. He’d have me flayed and tossed into the vat of kumquat juice he keeps handy in the smaller interdimensional place in the middle left-hand drawer of his oaken desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, yes, I will live forever! I &lt;strong&gt;cry&lt;/strong&gt; so like I am 16 again, or even 17. Immortality is only ever a very introverted goal. For narcissist assholes, this statement may seem counter-intuitive. They want &lt;strong&gt;LEGACIES&lt;/strong&gt;, after all. They think that a &lt;strong&gt;LEGACY&lt;/strong&gt; will buy them immortality. Bah! Immortality is an internal state that allows one to wander among the crevices of everyday invention. It is the passing of the dust motes and etchings on the walls of those crevices from short-term to long-term memory. It is a personal quest. It is life seen from within. Immortality is in the domain of the living, not the dead. &lt;strong&gt;LEGACIES&lt;/strong&gt;! Bah!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Waffles for Tea Leaves</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The tea is made. It steams beside my telephone and painted fish. My palate and stomach awaits a plate of waffles I just concocted. Yes, on weekends, I abandon my “diet”. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Plan!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Does routine really unhinge time so it passes like a flutter in a 12 year old hag’s loins? It depends whether it is an ingrained routine or a “conscious” routine. And I think that even the former can be converted into the latter if one denies the &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt; module of the brain dominance during said routine. The &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt; module is responsible for daydreaming. Or, rather, it is responsible for the inception of daydreaming. Other modules take over, focusing a daydream, an illusion, a distraction from the details of the moment. Yes, habitual routines can be &lt;strong&gt;boring&lt;/strong&gt; routines, but, as I discussed a few entries ago, concentrating on details of even scrubbing the filth from a fork or reorganizing the pinwheel collection one keeps in the vast, yawning, interdimensional gulf between the walls of the edifice you live in can become a &lt;em&gt;zen&lt;/em&gt; experience. The focus trains the mind to recognize true insight when it noses out of the &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Letting the &lt;em&gt;random pathway&lt;/em&gt; play constantly, and thus letting a succession of daydreams be the dominant mental state during ingrained routines, diminishes chances that one will recognize any unique insight in the random deluge of debris vomited by what I have come to call the &lt;em&gt;accursed module&lt;/em&gt;. Focus should always be the goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This also goes for creative routines, such as writing in one’s electronic dumping ground. I consider Martenblog an electronic dumping ground. Though some of the ideas that surface are potentially brilliant, it’s really a distillation of another module that is associated with the &lt;em&gt;accursed module&lt;/em&gt;. Most humans would name this module the &lt;em&gt;stream of conciousness&lt;/em&gt; module. So be it. I consider it a narrower version of Herr Accursed. So, the focus argument also goes for creative routines, such as writing in one’s electronic dumping ground. A narcissist asshole might argue that I am already focusing because I am writing, but I refer to the details between the words, the act itself, which is below each syntactic and semantic structure. Since the original topic was remembering the details of everyday life, doesn’t the pressure of my fingers on the keys of my mechanical keyboard count? Don’t the gentle creakings from the void between my walls count? In the end, the product can endure in its electronic, typewritten, tattooed, painted, spewed, broiled titrated or composed form, and furthermore the details of the process itself can pass from short-term to long-term memory.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Chasm Between Short-Term and Long-Term Memory</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/485.gmi</id>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Thank you for reminding me that I should be steeping my tea. Today, I drink &lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;, which differs from my &lt;em&gt;rough draft&lt;/em&gt; version of this entry, in which I was drinking &lt;em&gt;Lady Grey&lt;/em&gt;. The contrast is sharp, or, as we say in Lakife, &lt;em&gt;hele kotzom&lt;/em&gt;. Also, I commented in my &lt;em&gt;rough draft&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Lady Grey&lt;/em&gt; is tea for an elitist. In some way or another, I’m certainly an elitist. I also made the comment &lt;em&gt;British bastards&lt;/em&gt; in reference to &lt;em&gt;Lady Grey&lt;/em&gt;. I’m under the impression that all &lt;em&gt;Earl Grey&lt;/em&gt; style teas originate from the seed of Sri Lanka. Or at least their idea did. Therefore, &lt;em&gt;Sri Lankan bastards&lt;/em&gt;. What can I do, though? They are tasty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, is the tea of the common man. In some way or another, I’m certainly a common man. In my universe of one, I’m as common as they come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Today, I put on &lt;em&gt;Distant Void&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Dr Norah Lorway&lt;/strong&gt;, who evidently lives in Cornwall, a place to my liking. I can see how living there might inspire this music. It’s elliptic, yawning and disturbingly tranquil. In other words, I like it. I chose it after pulling up Bandcamp. Instead of going straight to &lt;em&gt;Puppy Bordiga&lt;/em&gt;‘s page and listening to his &lt;em&gt;Guitar Works&lt;/em&gt;, the feature on &lt;strong&gt;experimental music&lt;/strong&gt; caught my eye and after sampling another that was not to my liking, I settled on &lt;strong&gt;Dr Norah Lorway&lt;/strong&gt;. Yawning. Chasmic. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I caught myself earlier mentally planning what I shall do this morning and in what order. My first reaction was that creating such a routine in my mind for Friday morning was already extracting the morning from my life. My next feeling was that the details of the events I routinize will be lost. Naturally, the remains of the tasks (this writing episode being one of them) will remain to posterity. Well, they will remain in digital form until the heat death of the universe spreads the individual particles that represent them uniformly about the cosmos. That’s plenty of time for me to sit around, imbibe litres of vodka, and contemplate them. The details of the execution will be lost, drizzling trough the crevices of my short-term memory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an aside, Christián usually waxes obsequiously at length about the qualities of his &lt;em&gt;dad&lt;/em&gt;. Lately, he’s been praising the old man’s organization skills. The guy does seem meticulous from my plump friend’s descriptions. I’ve known Chris for over 16 years and an adjective I’d rarely associate with him is &lt;em&gt;organized&lt;/em&gt;. So, if he learns something from his father, good for him. Good for both of them. If his malady is anything like my ancient ways then the most difficult first step is seizing the impetus. I’m referring to the impetus to create, of course. Having my studio laid out before me so I can easily put any idea to “tape” is endlessly beneficial. My plump friend needs to get his fecal matter together and set up something similar, even on a tiny scale. Having one’s tools prepared to use at any arbitrary moment is mandatory for the creative spirit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In relation to that, remind me to stick my handwritten journal in my backpack. Oh, wait. I never go anywhere excepting to &lt;em&gt;Mercadona&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Lidl&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to the current topic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Details were slipping through the crevices in my mental edifice. Indeed. Though I know that the slippage will happen, has happened, is happening because my mental fondue is not capable of digesting multitudinous stimuli. Fucking subconscious filters. So far, I do not know many ways to capture individual details and pass them from short-term to long-term memory. One that does work is to immediately discuss the event with someone who is loitering in the area. That is, make it a more nebulous event. If the mind has further associations, the passage to long-term memory is facilitated. My experience bears this. An example that leaps to mind is a writing episode from 1993. I was sitting at a terminal set up by Craig in the house at Enfield. I typed some pretentious complex paragraph which could be interpreted in myriad manners. I then discussed it with Michael Achenbach, who was loitering in the common room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So - to pass an event more clearly from short-term to long-term memory, not only notice the details of the process, but also discuss (possibly even with yourself) the process or content produced by the process. There is a difference, again, between the &lt;em&gt;produced content&lt;/em&gt; and the &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt;, but they are entwined, I’m sure, as far as fixing one or both in long-term memory. My situation with Marisa worries me slightly in this regard. I can’t really talk to her to any depth about my creative endeavours, as they are not her cup of &lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;. I shall continue the plan of writing every morning until I have seven days worth of dribble. Then I’ll compile it, as I’m doing now. From time to time, I must randomly select a Martenblog entry and consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Part of Everyone is a Narcissist Asshole</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/484.gmi</id>

I put on the album &lt;em&gt;Perhaps&lt;/em&gt; by Harold Budd before beginning this moment-dump. I glanced through the review at Samadhi Sound previously. It’s an album of improvisations, like some of Budd’s other work. I appreciate that. Of course, I cannot pay attention to the &lt;strong&gt;details&lt;/strong&gt; whilst writing, but the ambience the sound-universe makes is splendid. I miss multitudinous details whilst attempting to commit the mortal sin upon focus: multitasking. Yes, listening to music during &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;programming&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;shaving the mouse found between the baseboard and the yawning interdimensional space between the walls of this edifice I live in&lt;/strong&gt; is multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve considered cutting out all &lt;em&gt;background activities&lt;/em&gt; during my days to try to focus better. This includes removing all the autonomic functions in my living corpse, resulting in the husk that now sits before the “terminal” typing in elaborations to a stream-of-consciousness moment-dump from last week. You see, I decided, to eke along my dissolving habit of writing, to do these moment-dumps every morning for approximately a week. Afterwards, I take them, as I’m doing now, and reform them into actual entries for the Martenblog. So far, the idea is worthwhile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve considered cutting out all &lt;em&gt;background activities&lt;/em&gt; during my days to try to focus better. My good buddy and workmate, James, has got it right. When I put on &lt;em&gt;Aranis&lt;/em&gt;, for example, at his place in Praha, he cannot work. He’s not familiar with the music and since it is both rhythmically and harmonically busy, it distracts him. Much like the people I was ranting about in the last entry, James is also a narcissist asshole, but the fact that he spurns listening to &lt;em&gt;Aranis&lt;/em&gt; is not a manifestation of that aspect of his personality. I’m even distracted, somewhat, by the sparse piano tones Budd put to platter as I type. The clustered, rhythmic arpeggios of the current piece ( &lt;em&gt;Moss Landing&lt;/em&gt; ) are distracting because they have melancholic beauty (the best type of beauty, in my opinion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast, I’ve noticed that when I’m programming and no music is playing, my mind begins to become numb. I cannot discount habit, however. The mind loves latching on to routines. It may be complaining that I am not following a normal &lt;em&gt;put on some background noise and program&lt;/em&gt; agenda. The lack of background information stupefies the environment. Or the lack of this information, though not analyzed in real time, diminishes my want or ability to function as a programmer, or even as a human, or mustelid, or interdimensional rodent. That being stated, I usually put on instrumental music because music with those pesky vocals is much &lt;strong&gt;too&lt;/strong&gt; distracting. A comparison can be made to music that is simply a melody or sparse piano tones without an &lt;strong&gt;apparent&lt;/strong&gt; harmonic backdrop. I enjoy this sort of music in isolation. That is, unlike programming, one of my mental modules does not get frustrated in the backdrop. That frustrated module (in the case of programming) without music begins to shudder and demand that the other mental faculties are taken down. It becomes a narcissist asshole.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Ache to be the Center of the Cosmos</title>

I interrupted myself by answering Christián’s comment concerning his current listening obsessions. This time round, it happens to be Brian Eno. Good for him. Not for Brian, but for Christián. Brian knows nothing of Christián. Actually, this also may be a good thing. So good for both of them. I’m happy that my friend is discovering music that I have been talking about, indeed &lt;em&gt;championing&lt;/em&gt; for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here’s my issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Some people have a manner of expressing themselves that rubs my fur incorrectly. Christián’s obsessions and his “excitement” in the moment about them is one example. Even if I’ve championed Eno for decades, when Christián discovers the music &lt;strong&gt;himself&lt;/strong&gt;, it is if he was the founder of the ambient institution and must proselytize it to even me. Perhaps I am taking his “excitement” as the wrong thing, but my impression is a forceful “evangelist” attitude. I’m aware that advocating for Eno is not a bad thing at all, but it is the manner that bothers me. It infuses my friend’s personality in many ways. A long list sits in journals askew on my bookshelves detailing this same phenomenon in others, &lt;strong&gt;and in myself&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This an indicator of narcissism. Because of it, my friend will die horribly plump and alone in a murky house in South Carolina, surrounded by reeking empty cans of Coors Light and dried strips of his own flesh, clawed away during nightmares of being spurned endlessly by nubile chicks. The wasting away, this punishment for egoism, of course, will only happen once all of his tasks for Flavigula are complete. I will discard him like a holed dishrag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I should be lighter on the imbeciles of the world. I recall when Lee (whom I still dream about frequently) discovered &lt;em&gt;The Final Cut&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, it’d been in my playlist since I was 15 (or thereabouts). It annoyed me to no end that he &lt;em&gt;obsessed&lt;/em&gt; about it. He played it whilst traipsing around in his underwear. He sang it ( &lt;em&gt;The Gunner’s Dream&lt;/em&gt;, I think ) in Acy’s shower during the bizarre summer of 1991.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Possibly I simply have problems with people who are &lt;em&gt;obsessive&lt;/em&gt; and what I see as narcissist outpourings are just a result of the narrow focus they have. What Lee was doing was finding joy in the discovery of something he loved. Or, well, being &lt;strong&gt;obsessed&lt;/strong&gt;. Same thing? Similar? I should give even narcissist assholes their temporary bliss before they either shoot themselves in the head at McDonald Observatory in West Texas or die in filth surrounded by Coors Light cans in South Carolina. After all, I am a fair fellow.&lt;/p&gt;

I’ll return after I begin the steeping of TEA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A concern I have lately is memory. I’m referring to the actual process of memory. It’s actually not a concern of just lately, but of most of my life. Unfortunately, when I address it, my strategies only work for a few days, maybe a week, perhaps an epoch or two, and then I lapse back into a malaise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Specifically, I’m writing about short-term memory. I have always somewhat had my &lt;em&gt;head in the clouds&lt;/em&gt;. Because of this, I miss details as I wander through my days. I’ve tried so-called &lt;em&gt;mindfulness meditation&lt;/em&gt; many times. Again, I get into it for a few days, maybe a week, perhaps an epoch or two, but then lapse into my normal &lt;em&gt;not practising mindfulness meditation&lt;/em&gt; routine. The &lt;strong&gt;new&lt;/strong&gt; strategy, which is not new at all, but devised by one of the mental modules floating around in my mind-soup during the endless journeys to and from the outskirts of Munich during the summer of 2001, is to be &lt;em&gt;meta-mindful&lt;/em&gt;. The process is simple and more reliable than actively trying to sit quietly and pay attention to surroundings. The key is to stamp out daydreaming. This is particularly important during mundane tasks such as washing the dishes, consuming vast quantities of vodka or planning the ascension of the mustelid regime in South Asia. Daydreaming is the assassin of attentive thought. Simply concentrate on the details of each task at hand. The expressive clankings of dishes of plates and glasses and subtle poppings of soap bubbles create a tapestry of sound. The wheezing and choking and burning burbling from your oesophagus are the last music you experience before falling into stupor. The chatter of whiskered muzzles and rustle of fur weave nuances into passing instants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The space between moments is the space where a mouse hides between the baseboard and the cavernous, interdimensional gulf known only to the architects of this building and to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, that’s the &lt;em&gt;mindfulness of the moment&lt;/em&gt;. Whilst washing the caked filth off a lasagna dish or equally whilst shaving the aforementioned mouse, I can pay attention to movements of my wrists, the poppings of soap bubbles and / or the scrape of the razor and how they orchestrate to create an atmosphere. I am brought to the idea that I am mostly concerned with sound worlds. &lt;strong&gt;Mainly&lt;/strong&gt; concerned with sound worlds. Since one of my concerns is creating music (in this particular infinity of epochs, anyway), it makes sense. Paying attention to ebb and flow of warmth in my muscles and currents of breeze on my skin could also be suitable &lt;em&gt;mindfulness&lt;/em&gt; opportunities, but, then again, that’d be &lt;em&gt;multitasking&lt;/em&gt;, the enemy of focus. &lt;/p&gt;

If the reach between what we perceive and what actually “is” is as infinite as it seems to me, then our perceptions during waking and our perceptions during dreaming are equally valid. It goes without saying, or writing, or squawking that our perceptions whilst flummoxed on some drug or another is also equally valid. As there are other shambling physical forms in the world, the way we perceive them during moments of wakefulness, dreaming, drugged out bliss or psychotic rage isn’t as important as the way we &lt;em&gt;react&lt;/em&gt; to our perceptions of them during moments of wakefulness, dreaming, drugged out rage or psychotic bliss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I posit that for the safety of all, each &lt;em&gt;flow of mental information&lt;/em&gt; should be separated from its fleshy container. How this is done is irrelevant. Transfer these &lt;em&gt;flows of mental information&lt;/em&gt; into digital form, giving each a universe created from all experienced whilst in fleshy form, including daydreaming, nightdreaming and drugged out bliss-or-rageful interludes. This way, since no fleshy forms are left, no fleshy form can cause damage to any other fleshy form. Each &lt;em&gt;flow of mental information&lt;/em&gt; flounders or flourishes in a universe of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve always had the premonition that this is similar to what happens anyhow when one’s &lt;em&gt;flow of mental information&lt;/em&gt; is about to cease. The brain constructs a completely new universe in which to live during its &lt;em&gt;final moments&lt;/em&gt;. This universe is basically reincarnation, and time is stretched to the length of a lifetime for the &lt;em&gt;dream&lt;/em&gt; during these moments. The process is, of course, also recursive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, see ya in the next life, brotha.&lt;/p&gt;

Instead of claiming that something is the &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt; of some genre or other category, I need to remember to use &lt;em&gt;my favourite&lt;/em&gt;, instead, not for &lt;strong&gt;political correctness&lt;/strong&gt;, of course, but to tone down all things arrogant inside me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Boorish when I awake. My nap was useless, of course, since now I feel much worse than I did before. Except for the fatigue, I am the same plus the added symptoms of too much sleep and not enough activity. I am very indisciplined. Solving this hateful aspect of my personality (which amounts to stamping it out) is a giant step on the way to enhancing my 1) creativity, 2) physical health, 3) mental prowess, 4) overall knowledge and 5) grades.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
My vigor for school is vanishing. I must, starting today – starting immediately after I finish my morning pages and check my mail – get back into the groove that held my needle in January. I have to play the tune of commitment to many hours of study so I can put more and more chunks of classwork, insipid as some of it seems, behind me. I am awestruck in the sight of those capable of holding fast to a study schedule and churn out exactly what the professors who preside want. They are portentous in that they will get this behaviour pattern through with sooner than I. They are players of the pattern, shaped by the American way and what is &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;. As I might say, my pattern is smooth, rubbed off. The original was stamped somewhere in my brain, but my conciousness took a file to it long ago. I would not be who I am today if this had not happened; I would be a harnessed horse like the rest, surely, but my own state, on which as maze I must, myself, carve, prevents me, subtly, from obtaining by the same means, what others find natural: IE, the will to work and &lt;em&gt;succeed&lt;/em&gt; in society’s mold. I must find a way to drive myself, alchemy myself some social gasoline so as not to jump into a pattern that I despise, but to run along side with freewheels (much like a car runs along side a train) to get to one or two of the same destinations – a diploma, a job and money enough to leave this fucking pit of a nation for good. I will have to borrow fuel from sources I can only barely imagine.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I am a fortunate soul (or rather, spirit flapping like a tattered flag forewarning of coming thunderstorms) in that I don’t have to worry about &lt;em&gt;grades&lt;/em&gt; any longer. Regardless of the dribble I wrote on 27 March 1995, I don’t think I seriously worried about them then, either, because most of my courses were metrically valuable. There was a bit of creativity involved in the steps to solving certain differential equations, but not much. The resultant &lt;em&gt;grade&lt;/em&gt; was clearly calculable. Life after university isn’t so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My experience with &lt;em&gt;professional&lt;/em&gt; work during the epochs since university can be summed up by what the lanky German dude whose name I forget told me in 2003. That company was &lt;em&gt;Extech&lt;/em&gt;. He told me that hirings were made 10% by demonstrable technical merit and 90% by gut / emotion / intuition. I’m not surprised that the company ceased to exist shortly afterwards. That had nothing to with me, of course, or I don’t think it did, anyway, as I was only in it for a quick buck until they figured out I was only in it for a quick buck. It was the attitude of the owner, of the lanky German dude whose name I forget, that killed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I don’t have a problem, necessarily, with &lt;em&gt;family businesses&lt;/em&gt;, per se, but think the concept shouldn’t extend beyond small, justifiably dubbed &lt;em&gt;mom &amp; pops&lt;/em&gt; and the apprenticeship model. When the &lt;em&gt;family business&lt;/em&gt; mentality extends into technology or creativity oriented businesses, I’ve experienced nothing but direness. I’ve drifted to this topic because it is an example of &lt;em&gt;hiring by gut feeling&lt;/em&gt; or, better, &lt;em&gt;hiring by emotion&lt;/em&gt; (or emotional blackmail?). Hanging out in companies that brought in project managers and even programmers and graphic designers because they were &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;old university drinking buddies&lt;/em&gt; has resulted in my own practically endless personal amusement. This amusement involved watching new &lt;em&gt;compañeros de trabajo&lt;/em&gt;, some suddenly my “bosses”, with minimal technical or design skills but sizeable egos, slowly poison their departments. Developers and graphic designers began dropping out like runners suddenly realising their marathon is a farce. They dropped out not because of a sudden vanishing of their skillset. They dropped out because of a occlusion in the workflow of the department and of the company as a whole. The &lt;em&gt;friends and family&lt;/em&gt; new hires and their unchecked egos wreaked havoc. Fuck um. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
At least I only have one fuckup to deal with work-relatedly during this epoch, and I know him strictly on a professional level. Oh, wait.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This morning, which is several mornings after I first started this entry, as the vim process sits open on the Raspberry Pi I call &lt;em&gt;Yak&lt;/em&gt; and therefore I intermittently add to it, helping Christián, as foul a person as he is, with his website reminded me of something Craig used to do, repeatedly, during that other epoch which was my time at Texas A&amp;M university. Were Craig asked for help in something programming or system administration related, he would &lt;strong&gt;gladly&lt;/strong&gt; help, but only to an extent. One, if not several, of the puzzle pieces would always be left undone for the asker to complete. The puzzle would be simplified, sure, but asker for help, in the end, always would have to help him / her / itself at least a bit. Craig would have made a great teacher. I respect my old friend’s behavior emanating from that ancient epoch more and more as I grow into decrepitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Concerning the harnessed horse: Since I am currently a form of harnessed horse, I need to sculpt the routine into a path as productive as possible. This is a time of transition in my life, a time that began roughly at the end of 2015. The harness solidified from steamy potential into something that drove me, though I was partly the one driving. My living situation was the other driver. It still is. In a way, it is frustrating and confining. On the other hand, I have had the most creative years since the late 90s / early 00s since the purchase of my blue Telecaster, which I have failed to give a name to, in November of 2016. Fifteen years of debauchery puro, of the so-called &lt;em&gt;bohemian life&lt;/em&gt; is exemplary of where a big part of my mind still wants to be. Oh, and Sweet Entropy will take me there again one fine day. Let’s just see how many albums I can churn out before that one fine day comes around.&lt;/p&gt;

I wonder what makes my upper torso smell good. On the days I wash my hair (every other day), Marcie always claims I smell very good, but, on the other days, I wash my face, neck and armpits with the same shampoo that my hair is cleansed with. Perhaps my hair influences my smell more than I can reckon from simple observation. If I shaved it off, I would not have this problem, surely, but I shall not. My hair is important now and I can’t get rid of it. It models a part of my personality as surely as the way my mouth twists into sardonic smirk when confronted with mindless blather from a typical teenager. Gandy, irresponsible, lethargic, helpless, immobile, stagnant, fertile, bombastic, burlesque, niggardly – which world does not go with the rest?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What kind of arrogant tripe is this? I am enjoying parts of this ancient journal I’m going through, but bits like this are laughable. I get that babble from teens can be tiring, and I was, indeed, in a relationship with a teen at the time. And if I recall correctly, I had many arguments with said teen about what it means to babble, what proper adults would call &lt;em&gt;small talk&lt;/em&gt;. I’m still not a fan even if I see its utility. I’ll let myself float away on the arrogance carpet and say that at this point in my life, I am beyond any need for &lt;em&gt;small talk&lt;/em&gt;. Fuck um. It’s possible that I floated on the &lt;em&gt;arrogance carpet&lt;/em&gt; frequently during my 20s. I was certainly what Acy liked to call an &lt;em&gt;intellectual elitist&lt;/em&gt;. Somewhere in the intervening decades, I leaped off that carpet, perhaps still floating high above the undulating floorings, and plunged into the funnel of humility. I passed through the infinitely narrow tube at the vertex and emerged an infinitely long chain of single quarks spanning the dance between the original cosmic bead and the heat death of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stabbing through the Bulwark</title>

  &lt;p&gt;
I just received a letter from the municipal court of Houston, surely declaring that my check bounced and I owe them a lot of money - $150 to be exact. My money situation is grim, actually. I owe Friendswood court $138 and Houston municipal, as noted, $150. Where the hell am I going to come up with the money? I’ll leave it up to God and his little guardian angels who flutter ‘round my head like moths around a blazing bulb.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
On the same note - I wonder when my Hawkwind t-shirts are going to come in - or if they are going to come in. The email about them was hauntingly ambiguous, keeping me up nights wond’ring aloud about the eventual outcome.   &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Happiness is a warm, glowing lamp shining on the pages of good science fiction. Drolling is inevitable when morning pages are in the works.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Do I sense some sort of excavation? My senses sometimes evaporate into a sort of ghoul watching from afar. One of my biggest problems is, when trying to concentrate, my mind goes into “meta-mode”, and starts thinking about trying to concentrate on something instead of actually concentrating on it like it should be doing. I’ll be sitting Zazen, counting, and finding myself doing well, following the numbers, then gasp because I was not following the numbers at all but &lt;em&gt;thinking about following them&lt;/em&gt;. It is this hierarchy that scares me. I feel my mind has already made up its mind about how it shall work forever and my concentration powers are ka-plooie, no good, wasted, curtailed, precluded, fundamentally fucked.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m pretty sure that I never received a Hawkwind t-shirt of any kind. I could order one now to make up for it. I could order three! Having checked with Redbubble, the source of my &lt;em&gt;Can&lt;/em&gt; t-shirts, I verified there are a number of Hawkwind ones, though mostly the usual suspects: &lt;em&gt;In Search of Space&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Space Ritual&lt;/em&gt;, etc. No &lt;em&gt;Levitation&lt;/em&gt;, but I paid out of the snout for &lt;em&gt;Church of Hawkwind&lt;/em&gt;. Odlično! According to the recent album grids I did, it’s, after all, one of the albums that &lt;strong&gt;changed things&lt;/strong&gt; for me. Though those grids were semi-arbitrary, I should dedicate a few blog entries to going through how my very &lt;strong&gt;soul&lt;/strong&gt; was subsumed into each of the albums scattered within them. Should I make a mental note of it? Mental notes don’t function well for me, being subsumed into the murkiness of synaptic infinity. Should I make a Joplin note of it? Will it come to anything? Let’s stake our bets, Herr Reader of this Rambling Void. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m still plagued by the problem I described on 24 March, 1995. My mind is a multi-level abstraction generation demon. That last sentence was an attempt to type like James sometimes talks. The whole of this paragraph so far is an example of the plague I wrote about on 24 March, 1995. One thing that has tamed this savage part of my module-sphere is guitar practise. Oh, I concentrate! Unlike now, obviously. The harmonium emanating from the twin near-field monitors aside my desk, because of its sheer beauty, interferes with even stepping up and down that ladder of metas. However, that is sheer distraction, not thinking about thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I haven’t sat Zazen in centuries. Possibly the last time I seriously did something similar consistently was during summer of 2001, though it was a &lt;em&gt;walking Zazen&lt;/em&gt;, performed on my way from the S-bahn to work and back again every day. My breathing and steps subsumed me. I was bathed in shimmering light, dissolved into the quantum foam and never seen or heard from again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This entry is full of true stories. Stories that bathe you in shimmering light and dissolve you into the quantum foam so that you are never seen or heard from again. The end of ever story is the same, regardless of being bathed in shimmering light and being dissolved into the quantum foam and never being seen or heard from again. They are all tumbling down the same funnel into the same infinitely narrow spout.&lt;/p&gt;

There is just Shambal Brambel, sitting sessile on his bed, on an unnamed moon. Breezes howl against the vacant space around the vast pine box surrounding him.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
You can’t live your life in a pine box, mister. The kitchen yawned as I walked into its midst this morning, then settled back into some sort of dumb, droning daftness that kitchens are known for. I opened the refrigerator to obtain my morning meal. The garbage can stood like a dungheap in defiance of anyone who dared move it, try to sink clean hands into its murky recesses, grasping for, perhaps, some sort of handle to use for easy carrying.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can certainly live your life in a gypsum plasterboard box, however, mister. Until minutes before (or even &lt;strong&gt;moments&lt;/strong&gt; before) writing the last sentence, I did not know that &lt;em&gt;pladur&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;plasterboard&lt;/em&gt; in English. The only time I was part of the &lt;em&gt;bubble&lt;/em&gt; that is construction (of houses / apartments / woodsheds / kennels / yawning archways to the passively malignant stars / etc) was when I was 9 or 10 (I’d have to consult my father) during the construction of what we later, even decades later, called the &lt;em&gt;new room&lt;/em&gt; in the house I grew up in. So there you go, hoss. &lt;em&gt;Pladur&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;plasterboard&lt;/em&gt; in English. You have learned a new word, as have I. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
But -&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
You can certainly live your life in a gypsum pladur box, however, mister. When I walked into our plasterboard kitchen, it did not yawn, nor did it mutter obscenities at me as I reached for the &lt;em&gt;English Breakfast&lt;/em&gt; tin box that actually contains &lt;em&gt;Touareg&lt;/em&gt;. After banging the mesh time and again on the inside of the garbage bin until I considered it clean, I sprayed it with what I consider &lt;em&gt;the hose&lt;/em&gt;, placed it in its place in the tea kettle gifted to me by proxy from Lidl, and filled it with 92 degree water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I squatted and considered the garbage bin. It was practically empty, very unlike a dungheap, and in fact smelled pleasant. I gave it a small shove to see it if would react. It wobbled then settled back into place. I continued to consider, but this time the distance, superficiality and stark difference between two distant snapshots in a life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
My cereal did not snap, crackle nor pop when it was suddenly awash with a bowl full of milk. I always fill the bowl too full of milk and waste. That excess (that part that doesn’t get eaten directly with the cereal) goes down the drain of the sink. Would I be some sort of phobe in never drinking the remaining portions of milk? I hope not. Phobes are, unlike Phoebes, not squishy and sometimes fun to fuck.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
The chair titillates my back - the lumbar part - so I sit up straighter to alleviate the uncomfortable poking sensation - not that a chair can necessarily poke, being that poking is an active action, but perhaps &lt;em&gt;jut&lt;/em&gt;, since to jut you don’t very well have to be sentient. I’m glad I clarified that poking will be, by me, always used only in the sense of a sentient creature mindfully willing the act, whereas jutting can be accomplished by just about anyone or anything of particularly any geometric structure.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve mentioned to Herr Neumann many times that I don’t eat cereal. Well - the proof is typewritten for all to see. I used to eat cereal. Obviously not the type that snapped, crackled or popped, however. The idea of the excess milk spiraling down the drain amuses me. It also reminds me of another ancient journal entry where I wrote of standing in front of a toilet, urinating, and always flushing before the stream concluded, attempting to time the whole urination resolution correctly. The connection with the milk is tenuous, but my associative module in the squishy mass of cerebral tissue housed in some cranium or another is always alert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Pouring the excess milk down the drain also reminds me of the sheer defiance I used to have of &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; established norm, even in the private of my own home with nothing but a few synths and a guitar as witnesses. That defiance still lives within me, though it is diluted with time and compromise. I long to reawaken its vigor, though direct like a scalpel, not as the scattershot rifle of decades gone by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Jutting&lt;/em&gt; is frequent in sentient objects, I have found. Its most frequent in those sentient objects that are considered either family, close friends, compañeros de trabajo or assholes in general. Unlike &lt;em&gt;poking&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;jutting&lt;/em&gt; performed by sentient objects is usually passive. They obtrude into your space, always a constant burr in the lumbar portion of the back, usually to remind you something must be performed, done usually ritually, habitually and with more and more listlessness as life goes by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My cynicism certainly doesn’t wane with time. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
You cannot live your life in a pine box. Lee asked to be buried in an unmarked pine box. I still wonder if he got his wish. He certainly was, posthumously, denied one of his requests – that of not having a funeral. The loving bastards went and mourned his decaying body just like he hoped they wouldn’t. Oh well – some people can’t be stopped from doing the right thing and fucking things up.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The types of boxes that people live in are what I call &lt;em&gt;bubbles&lt;/em&gt;. It’s possible that some of those bubbles are made of pine. I’d say that it’s even likely. The smell is pleasant. Who wouldn’t want to live in a pine bubble? Since the bubbles themselves are a psychological or cultural or mental construct to begin with, the material of their construction is immaterial. So, in this regard, we all live in pine boxes and in pine boxes within other pine boxes. We even live in pine boxes intersecting with other pine boxes. Sometimes the pine is less opaque than it should be. It can even be translucent or fully transparent, though the idea of said box / bubble / whathaveyou might break down at that point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Decades later, I don’t think about Lee’s demise as much, naturally. The quoted parts of this blog entry are from a spiral notebook written during the spring of 1995. That part of my tramp through the pasture was one of imminent transition, and the feeling coincides with my current position in the pasture. Time slithers alongside differently as age subsumes me, showing me the gelling decades being absorbed into the passage itself.&lt;/p&gt;

Herr Christián mentioned that he considers the &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt; those that feel their ilk, meaning those closest to them, meaning their families, deserve to be in some means &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; others. In that the so-called &lt;strong&gt;nobility&lt;/strong&gt; in the forlorn times was something akin (pun intended) a giant family, he is correct. Familiarity breeds a feeling of superiority, a group-think nobility. This idea extends from the family to the community and to the city and nation. It is another form of bubble, and concentric bubbles with varying degrees of permeability, unifying in one sense, but beds of xenophobia in another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As Shambal says, &lt;strong&gt;fuck um&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Tentacles of the Ruling Class</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I started reading &lt;em&gt;The Lost Art of Scripture&lt;/em&gt; by Karen Armstrong yesterday. I read another one of her books in my early twenties and it helped spawn a part of my life very interested in exploring religion, myth and their effects on culture and the people I knew at the time. During more recent decades, I’ve separated religion from what Karen calls the arts and left it in a box to rot under the bed in the apartment I lived in back then in Houston. Perhaps part of the present &lt;em&gt;Bobbus&lt;/em&gt; wants to summon a bit of that past &lt;em&gt;Bobbus&lt;/em&gt; and re-explore those concepts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Certainly, a mental struggle against ideologues throughout my existence has engendered cynicism. I’ve come close, but I wouldn’t say I’ve ever completely immersed myself in atheism. I’ve always retained at least a small sense of wonder for the ineffable. Karen states repeatedly in the introduction of the book, we cannot discount logos for mythos nor vice-versa, and I am in complete agreement. In fact, as I wrote, religion and its &lt;em&gt;scriptures&lt;/em&gt; and ritual surrounding them were always a part of the arts. Just recently (century-wise), occidental culture has moved to quash that idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Grinding the ideologues up into fertilizer for the plants on my balcony is the first step. The second is to immerse myself once again in the shifting dialogue between mythos and logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first thing that hit me was this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
We shall see that in every agrarian society, a small aristocracy, together with its retainers, seized the surplus grown by their peasants and used it to fund their cultural projects, forcing ninety per cent of the population to live at subsistence level.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Regardless of mythos and the wisdom of &lt;em&gt;scriptures of old&lt;/em&gt;, I still stand firm in my belief that those who want to backtrack into some past system of ideology / laws to solve current problems (at whatever level of granularity) are imbeciles. In the world of art and music, it is equally or even more true. I’ve had numerous conversations with Herr Christián lately concerning the &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt; and its ties to classically trained musicians he knows, most notably his friend Krzys, an opera singer of “note” from some Slavic nation I forget the name of. (There are just so &lt;strong&gt;many&lt;/strong&gt; of them!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
What Karen states was once the unbending norm, but I posit that the &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt; no longer exists in any form resembling what it was in those forlorn times. A far greater percentage of humanity have &lt;em&gt;aristocratic&lt;/em&gt; beads hanging about its neck, each giving us time out of &lt;em&gt;serfdom&lt;/em&gt; to pursue cultural / artistic projects. Logos, or humanity’s success in technological progress, is the plinth on which we stand that brings us up to the level of the olden &lt;em&gt;aristocracy&lt;/em&gt;. Said classical purists who cling to the times where only the &lt;em&gt;chosen&lt;/em&gt; could enter into and flourish in the arts are living in a rapidly diminishing bubble. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

Habitually in Spain, it’s seen as &lt;strong&gt;maleducación&lt;/strong&gt; to directly tell someone you dislike what they have suggested to you or given to you as a gift. I suppose that to some extent, this practise would be considered &lt;strong&gt;maleducación&lt;/strong&gt; in most cultures. Sadly, its effects are detrimental to a relationship. In fact, the effects are so detrimental that I’d place them on the level of, say, binding one’s friend to an outcropping overlooking a churning sea of pus so that a &lt;strong&gt;goat&lt;/strong&gt; can consume his / her pancreas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marisa’s sister, María Jose, bakes a fish cake every xmas for the entire family. Of course, the entire family despises the dish, though they are &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to consume it. Why are they &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to consume it? Well, they wish to spare María Jose’s feelings, of course! So she prepares it unfailingly each xmas. Wouldn’t it be better to make her feel bad for a short period by telling her the truth so that she can move on and spend her time baking something everyone will enjoy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The spongy wall of &lt;em&gt;appropriateness&lt;/em&gt; only allows certain acts to be criticized. Somehow it is proportional to how original or how &lt;strong&gt;traditional&lt;/strong&gt; the act is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Miguel suggested a semi-documentary for us to watch the other day. In my opinion, and also in Marisa’s, it is awful, detailing a part of life in the United States that we have no interest in. Miguel can revel in it. I don’t have a problem with that. But I’m not allowed to tell him that I disliked it. He’ll never be able to align his suggestions to what is actually enjoyable for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For most, this type of critique is reserved for their closest friends and &lt;strong&gt;sometimes&lt;/strong&gt; family. I task myself to break this cultural more. Fuck um. Humans that are close to me need to know when they are &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; something abominable so they can either form it into something more palatable or swap it out for a less abominable abomination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Other sides to this story exist, of course, especially in the case of art and the importance (or lack thereof) of an &lt;em&gt;audience&lt;/em&gt;, and if the point was to create an abomination in the first place. I’ve written about these topics before and shall again. The reader of this particular abomination is now tasked with baking a fish cake that is only moderately abominable.&lt;/p&gt;

It seems to me that a certain percentage of the violation of nature that I call the &lt;strong&gt;human race&lt;/strong&gt; has an irksome habit. In fact, it’s so irksome, that many a times, I wish for these peasants to drown in their own blood. The paradox is that this &lt;strong&gt;habit&lt;/strong&gt;, in the correct context, can be positive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I require concise answers to questions in my work, and not only in my work but in other aspects of my life. When I ask a colleague a question, I don’t want a slice of their inner dialog combined with a vague pretension of an answer. If said colleague doesn’t know the answer, then they can kindly point me in the right direction and spare me a snapshot of a turbid inner life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This malady is exacerbated when the person ostensibly answering my question is of the &lt;strong&gt;marketing&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;idea man&lt;/strong&gt; ilk. In fact, the tendency of this ilk to dish out a slice of inner dialog instead of giving tight, controlled answers leads me to the conclusion that they all are better off used as fertilizer for my opium farm. To counter my complaints, such “people” answer with enlightenments along the lines of &lt;strong&gt;well, my mind is so rich with ideas that I cannot contain myself&lt;/strong&gt;. Write it in a fucking blog. What you find to be insight is mostly dribble. Someone else can sort through the ramblings to find the 0.46% that may be of value to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The illness springs from the &lt;strong&gt;storyteller&lt;/strong&gt; archetype - the old man in the center of the ring who recounts (highly edited and enhanced) tales of his tedious life. This archetype lives strong in self-proclaimed entertainers in our epoch, jokesters and other ego-addicts. My recommendation is to write a book or at least a blog. That way, if I spend time with the ramblings, at least I will have chosen to do so. Don’t bombard me with an inner dialog that you don’t have the willpower to tame and especially when I need a concise answer to a question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
About the &lt;strong&gt;habit&lt;/strong&gt; being positive in the correct context - I changed my mind. They should all DIE.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Musical Black Box</title>

I’m often overwhelmed by the amount of music that both exists and appeals to me on an immediate surface level. The question is, how do I choose which are &lt;strong&gt;worthy&lt;/strong&gt; of profound examination? My conclusion is that the choice is entirely arbitrary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometimes I’ll elect a group / artist / project to explore by association with others I’ve previously delved into. Last year’s &lt;strong&gt;Utopia Strong&lt;/strong&gt; is a prime example, as it’s a Kavus Torabi project. I choose others because of &lt;strong&gt;social&lt;/strong&gt; association. Lately this means through acquaintences on Sonomu.Club. Historically, I’ve found much to like through acquaintences on &lt;strong&gt;progressiveears&lt;/strong&gt; (and in ancient times, rec.music.progressive). I also shouldn’t forget friends who ramble on and on about certain artists. I tend to check those out, as well, though at times with trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But again, the previous paragraph indicates over-saturation. I have to thin the elite herd and / or cherry-pick. These decisions to explore deeply, as I typed cheerily a few paragraphs ago, are arbitrary. Last year, I decided I’m going to be a fan of &lt;strong&gt;Lady With&lt;/strong&gt;. I had enjoyed what I heard and also other projects involving the composer, but it took a conscious decision to make time to &lt;strong&gt;get into&lt;/strong&gt; the musical universe of the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m guessing youth saw me having more visceral reactions to musics and choosing explorations on a &lt;strong&gt;lizard brain&lt;/strong&gt; level. Those days are long dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;

Walking through the Pagan Park in Seminole, Texas, or perhaps whilst visiting the casino in Hobbs with my parents, a thought struck and amused me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Say that living beings (all of them) have some sort of primordial force that various humans term &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt;. This premise is frighteningly widespread. I say &lt;em&gt;frighteningly&lt;/em&gt; because I see myself as a rational guy who frowns and even scoffs at superstitions. To each his own, sure, but even novel and film related ghost stories give me problems these days. Perhaps it is my decrepitude. I am, after all, several epochs old. Anyway, that is a separate subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back on track - Say that living beings (each one of them) have a primordial interior force. It exists symbiotically with our living corpse, but doesn’t deteriorate with time. Various humans dub this &lt;em&gt;soul&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;spirit&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;elephantine farce&lt;/em&gt;, depending on whom you ask. It doesn’t &lt;em&gt;cease&lt;/em&gt;, however, after the living corpse stops its elliptical ambulations. Taking the Buddhist standpoint, the primordial force passes directly into another living corpse after death. It makes sense to me that it’d elect a being &lt;em&gt;conceived&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;born&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;whatever moment you’d like to choose&lt;/em&gt; at the same instant of the aforementioned living corpse’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Given this theory, a &lt;strong&gt;spirit&lt;/strong&gt; previously inhabiting a human has an infinitesimal chance of residing in another human. Most likely, that &lt;strong&gt;force&lt;/strong&gt; carries on in a paramecium or lichen. Personally, I hope my personal (I laughingly call it &lt;strong&gt;personal&lt;/strong&gt;) primordial force, wiped clean of those pesky memories, occupies a widely distributed slime mold. How’s that for megalomania?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Denial of Immediacy</title>

A recurring bump in interaction with a friend who will remain anonymous other than saying he has what I call the &lt;em&gt;Newman&lt;/em&gt; disease and both severe dyslexia and dyscalculia again happened yesterday. I suggested a course on Javascript using exercism.io, a useful site for learning programming languages at your own pace - ie, when you have free time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Again, I got an offhand comment about &lt;code&gt;js&lt;/code&gt;, but nothing more. Same old story, different epoch. Usually, when I get this sort of response from someone, I blink a few times and move on with my life. Some humans and even mustelids are interested neither in taking general advice or in intellectual self-improvement. Specifically, some are just not interested in educational tasks that will take a (even sometimes very small) chunk of time even if rationally they understand it will diminish various other chunks of future time and especially alleviate frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Usually, I’d say &lt;em&gt;fuck um&lt;/em&gt; and move on, but this oxlet with &lt;em&gt;Newman&lt;/em&gt; disease (among others) is a particularly good friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My impression is that there is an aversion here to any learning that doesn’t have &lt;em&gt;intuitive&lt;/em&gt; appeal. It’s an issue that pokes at my enlarged and pustulant liver because it also affected me for many epochs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My path through primary, middle and high school was so easy that I learned no useful study skills. I mastered everything hurled at me intuitively. I received a nasty blow to the ego when I walked into the University of Texas at Austin and not everything came so easily. I had to sit down and feel myself through a maze of knowledge without that intuitive olfactory sense that leads the precocious rat to the fermented mold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I tripped and found myself sprawled into a world where I had to grapple with knowledge and especially &lt;em&gt;process&lt;/em&gt; to reach any sort of mastery. Bastards. Since, during my infancy and adolescence, I was showered with praise for my &lt;em&gt;gift&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;intelligence&lt;/em&gt;, climbing the debris-littered slope probably took longer than for those who didn’t have it so “easy” during the formative years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These epochs, I’m wary of anything that comes completely intuitively. I realize that is possibly an extreme, but I find constant self-observation appealing. Hand me a platter of puzzles I must unlock to get at the foodstuffs instead of a steaming döner in a paper sack, please. The hunger will encourage discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The appeal of immediacy is undeniable, but just like plunging into a long term relationship simply because another human or mustelid is feisty in the burrow, initial wonder can lead to debris dodging and bug fixing for epochs to come. I haven’t seen a concise proportional measure ‘tween effort and reward, but am pretty sure always taking the &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, intuitive path doesn’t work out so well for &lt;strong&gt;anyone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Murderous Flash</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/444.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/444.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, in the early evening, I had a flash like a sudden fever that struck me then left, but returned in reverberating waves during the following hours. The feeling had subsided completely by the time I passed into sleep hours later, but the thought structure it left behind remained. It still remains today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The collection of wealth for its own sake is an abomination. Moreover, the collection of wealth to pool into a &lt;em&gt;family trust&lt;/em&gt; is equally evil. Common regurgitations I perceive are along the lines of &lt;em&gt;I’m saving so my children can have a better life&lt;/em&gt;. But what these egocentric oafs are really doing is teaching the same behaviour to the offspring in effort to hoard wealth into a &lt;em&gt;dynasty&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It’s somewhat the same as the mafia strategy, concentrating hoardings in the family throughout generations to no ends but augmenting the &lt;em&gt;pile&lt;/em&gt;. The dragon in &lt;em&gt;Grendel&lt;/em&gt; floats to mind, but on a hereditary scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Being a speciesist, or even a proponent of all life, in general, I find concentrations of power, wealth, or any sort of potential detrimental to what I feel is the &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;. I can only peripherally understand it from the point of view of the hoarders, assume their motives, of course, but the &lt;em&gt;portion&lt;/em&gt; I understand sickens me. I strikes like a fever at this &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;, which seems to be diverted and diluted again and again by generational wealth hoarding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Gather a pile of gold and sit on it.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m about to use the word &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; extensively in the following paragraph. Thus, I am accused of instructing others in the way they should act. It could be seen as my own form of fundamentalism. So be it if it is seen that way. I write what I feel would improve the world in general, and in specific, relations between &lt;em&gt;communities&lt;/em&gt; in our species.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My thoughts are that each individual, and on less granular scale, each &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;peer group&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;organization&lt;/em&gt;, should to make a contribution from their hoarding to the &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;. These contributions should be anonymous so they do not cause a fluctuation in the aesthetic perception of said individual or group. They shouldn’t be a one time thing, akin to a  religious act of being &lt;em&gt;saved&lt;/em&gt; by the one time scandal of letting the Jesus creature into their lives.  Direct application of &lt;em&gt;funds&lt;/em&gt; can be substituted by substantial acts of kindness. Either way, a portion of the wealth hoard is diffused back into the &lt;em&gt;flow of life&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My seething hatred at those who pile their gold solely for their kin and for no other reason to &lt;strong&gt;pile their gold&lt;/strong&gt; and teach their offspring to do the same has faded. The impression remains. The seething hatred has faded, but I’d still not mind were many of them used as fertilizer. We need more fertilizer around here, after all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Task for my Pet Tardigrade and its Multitudinous Foals</title>

Taylor asked me yesterday what are five things I did during the decade that is coming to a close that made it worth it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Before I begin a formal list, I’ll say the overreaching concept that made the decade &lt;em&gt;worth it&lt;/em&gt; was the sheer enjoyment of as many moments as possible during the said decade. Being that a &lt;em&gt;moment&lt;/em&gt; can be regarded as an infinetesimal span of time, I had the possibility to experience infinite enjoyable moments, causing death by cerebral hemorrhage in several infinities of parallel quantum universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
I started seriously composing and playing music again.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;em&gt;dearth of music&lt;/em&gt; years were between 2002 and 2008, more or less. During that time, I tossed away any aspiration of even picking up my guitar, much less letting it speak into the antiquated tape machines I still held on to for years. I certainly didn’t give up &lt;em&gt;listening&lt;/em&gt; intently to music, however, and attended many concerts. Those are other stories that may or may not be told in this or some other member of some other infinity of parallel quantum universes. I don’t encourage you to wait for their telling, though you may do so, if you so wish. I will not be held responsible, however, if you wither and dessicate during the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In 2010, when I lived in New Cross Gate, I earnestly dabbled with electronic music for the first time. Ironically, now that I’ve incorporated modular synth and whimsical Supercollider forays into my compositions, none of that original dabbling has &lt;em&gt;seen the light&lt;/em&gt;. One piece, &lt;em&gt;The Fen&lt;/em&gt;, will eventually be resurrected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Tony and I created a collection of improvisations, some of which I’m afraid to relisten to, during the following year. We also worked on some crudities I wrote in 2008 whilst living in Hůrka. &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.bandcamp.com/track/fold&quot;&gt;Fold&lt;/a&gt; is a “modern” version of one of those crudities. I plan to pull &lt;em&gt;Union&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Reduction&lt;/em&gt; from their tombs, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most importantly, I composed &lt;em&gt;Cycle&lt;/em&gt;, a seventeen minute or so piece deeply set in a ravine of minimalism. A version exists purely as midi. This template can be expanded and mechanically fleshed by electronics, guitar and gargling voices set bringing an end to the plague that is the “American” way of life and that has poisoned so much of Europe. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another few dead years followed during which I frittered about in Boston and tampered with the destiny of Mustelids in Spain. Whilst remaning in Spain I bought a utter trozo de hovno kytara &lt;em&gt;Pignose&lt;/em&gt; and started practising again. I didn’t at first consider composing or revising past &lt;em&gt;glories&lt;/em&gt;, but just practising. I practised until my fingers bled. I practised until my liver drooped from my abdomen. I practised until the Heat Death of a few infinities of parallel quantum universes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I spent 2017 and the first few months of 2018 playing in a &lt;em&gt;duo&lt;/em&gt;. As little as I cared for the humour or attitute of my partner in this venture, my point of view expanded and those dank days flowered into whatever sort of monstrosities one could describe the first few Flavigula albums as. I dumped the duo and the rancid individual I was strung up with, tossed away my noose and dove into the psychedelic maelstrom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
I became better at letting go / not obsessing about &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fixations take up chunks of time in the lives of many people I know. Not only are they &lt;em&gt;fixations&lt;/em&gt;, but fixations on things that do absolutely nothing to further their intellectual or creative (or both) pursuits. I’ve gone to great lengths to dissolve an obsessive compulsive disorder I had. Best is the ability to concentrate on what I want to concentrate without some mental module I have no control of sucking away my time and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Or, one might say, I became more of a &lt;em&gt;sociopath&lt;/em&gt;. That would be the correct perception since I have become Catholic and therefore see all life in discreet blocks of black and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My oversensitive persona of youth and 20s had been fading for some time, in any case. The road to a firmer self realization and self esteem had already been tread. The decade simply saw these facets become more prominent. Marisa calls it Aspergers. Whatever one wants to call it, I find it a blessing from the almighty Baal itself. Yes - I will speak my mind. Yes - I will care little of what you think of me (unless I know you very well). But also I’ll listen to your reasoned discourse. Put away your mannered ravings. They do not appeal to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
I narrowed my fields of concentration.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Following in the footsteps of my desensitization to the majority of humanity, I felt mortality encroaching from a vague distance. The realization that time is limited is something most are not willing to approach during their youths, or if so, only in a bombastic or melodramatic way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I used to be happy being a mustelid of broad knowledge. Now my objective is to be a mustelid of profound knowledge in a limited number of areas. Ok, &lt;em&gt;knowledge&lt;/em&gt; may be too specific a word here. Simply put, I limit my concetration to fields that interest me most, such as music, programming and worshipping goats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In stark contrast to these self-absorbed pursuits, I tasked myself with opening myself to empathy that I’d rejected so long. Having been raised in the hellish &lt;em&gt;entorno&lt;/em&gt; of Fort Stockton, it’s been a arduous journey recuperating genuine compassion for humanity. I believe my love for animal life and mustelidae in specific assisted this eternal work in progress. Constant observation of ignorance and stupidity in every village square has not done much to assist this eternal work in progress. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
4 &amp; 5. I’ll have to think of other abstractions that have been important to me in the receding decade. Perhaps I’ll come up with something soon, but, as I wrote earlier, don’t dessicate waiting for me to do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
A list of discreet occurances that pivoted my life during the receding decade (or ones that I feel could be pivot points influencing the encroaching decade):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Lisa Kammerud (December, 2009, actually)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Tuzla, as a discreet, three month point  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Metting Jeremy Croteau  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Starting a company with James  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Connecting with my biological son  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Matthew Walsh  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Daniel García  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Two short films with Dani (as discreet points)  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Tiit Maran  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
Meeting Marisa  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>My Collection of Originalities is Thinning</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/442.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/442.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
In brief conversation with Marisa’s mother, Ilu, I encountered an ingrained form of response, or so it seemed to me. I stated &lt;em&gt;We are leaving within an hour.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Marcharemos dentro de una hora.&lt;/em&gt;) and she immediately came back with &lt;em&gt;Or even sooner!&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;O incluso más pronto!&lt;/em&gt;). I immediately correct her, as I am wont to do. Some call me a &lt;em&gt;pedant&lt;/em&gt; for such behaviours. Fuck um. Nothing against Ilu, but I find such responses a symptom of sloppy thinking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I like to hang back a bit with my thoughts before coming out with the first phrase that tingles my tongue. I’m unsure if I am among the majority that &lt;em&gt;perform&lt;/em&gt; this way. I’m all for saying what’s on one’s mind, but when those thoughts come out in &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt; or stock phrases, I wonder about the precision of expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Thus the central point of this entry. As I grow towards decrepitude, shrinking further into the groaning corporeal husk that houses my hara, I find myself surrounded more and more frequently by people who, instead of discursive conversation, resort to retorting in phrases which seem carved into their mental language tablets as if into stone. Certain stock phrases recur, recited in various orders to achieve various level of vagary. I’m aware that I am suppose to &lt;em&gt;sense&lt;/em&gt; the meaning behind each black box after black bundle of words. I should interperet them in context just like a set a gesticulations. However, this process leaves me deeply dissatisfied. I don’t want to talk to a magician who has a bag containing a set number of stock phrases. He pulls one after another from said bag, sorts and assembles them as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An interesting assement of &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt;, as they are called in Spanish, is that they tend to create tighter bonds between community members, especially of those &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt; are particularly local. They toughen the skin of the bubble. In other words, they further isolate the community from the outside with a barrier of impenetrable phrasiology. An outsider will have a harder time integrating when they don’t know the inner significance of &lt;em&gt;three noses to the wind&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;he buried a pumkin near the ravine&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One could argue that such &lt;em&gt;dichos&lt;/em&gt; give a particular bubble (community) flavour of its own, differentiating it from multitudinous other bubbles wielding their own stock phrases. My view is that this &lt;em&gt;tendency&lt;/em&gt; is a barrier to fluid communications between bubbles and a barrier to globalism. It’s a small step towards culture-centrism, nationalism and a type of fundamentalism that irks me.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How I Ruptured my Cerebrum Implementing Activity Pub</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/441.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/441.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I spent a few months on and off, that is to say, not very consistently, attempting to get this blog &lt;strong&gt;Activity Pub Sensitive&lt;/strong&gt;. There were many false starts, many moments where I gave up, many spilled comestibles and one or two plagues of sentient lice. In the end, my implementation is far from &lt;em&gt;perfect&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;finished&lt;/em&gt;, but it does what I need it to do for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m in metaphysical debt to the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://flak.tedunangst.com/post/ActivityPub-as-it-has-been-understood&quot;&gt;Activity Pub as it has Been Understood&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://tinysubversions.com/notes/reading-activitypub/&quot;&gt;How to Read the Activity Pub Specification&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary&quot;&gt;Activty Streams Vocabulary&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#followers&quot;&gt;Activity Pub Specification&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My code is here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Martenblog is a single user federated app, so, unlike #mastodon or Pleroma. This &lt;em&gt;single user&lt;/em&gt; is the manifestation of the blog, perhaps, were it sentient. Perhaps it is. I’m not sure. Whereas &lt;strong&gt;Actors&lt;/strong&gt; on Mastodon are indicated by &lt;code&gt;https://instance/users/username&lt;/code&gt; (I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;&gt;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&lt;/a&gt; on Mastodon), my singular actor is &lt;code&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&lt;/code&gt;. I didn’t come up with this genericism myself, but by stealing the idea from … well, it seems I cannot find the repository any longer. I am also in metaphysical debt to this &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; who did a Node.js implementation for his own blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;curl -k https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&lt;/code&gt; will show you my actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Backtracking slightly, I found it necessary to implement &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7033&quot;&gt;webfinger&lt;/a&gt; so that other servers could see me. My initial testing goal was to be able to type @martenblog@flavigula.net into the search field on Mastodon and find the manifestation of Martenblog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  def webfinger do
    json = %{
      aliases: [
        &quot;https://#{@domain}/ap/actor&quot;
      ],
      links: [
        %{
          href: &quot;https://#{@domain}/ap/actor&quot;,
          rel: &quot;self&quot;,
          type: &quot;application/activity+json&quot;
        }
      ],
      subject: &quot;acct:martenblog@#{@domain}&quot;
    }
    json
  end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I suppose that’s pretty self explanatory. You can see the result at &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/webfinger&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/webfinger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
While I was at it, I added the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/host-meta&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/host-meta&lt;/a&gt; endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;XRD xmlns=&quot;http://docs.oasis-open.org/ns/xri/xrd-1.0&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Link rel=&quot;lrdd&quot; template=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/webfinger?resource={uri}&quot; type=&quot;application/xrd+xml&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/XRD&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo&lt;/a&gt; endpoint:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;links&quot;: [
    {
      &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.0&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo/2.0.json&quot;
    },
    {
      &quot;rel&quot;: &quot;https://nodeinfo.diaspora.software/ns/schema/2.1&quot;,
      &quot;href&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/.well-known/nodeinfo/2.1.json&quot;
    }
  ]
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And the two endpoints referenced within nodeinfo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{

The code for those are in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&lt;/a&gt; along with every endpoint of my website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I only want to &lt;em&gt;federate&lt;/em&gt; blog entries to people who follow me from other regions of the Fediverse. An api endpoint exists for this, appropriately named &lt;em&gt;followers&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/followers&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/followers&lt;/a&gt;) Though I implemented the endpoint and find it likely that it is required to do so to have a functioning server, the resulting &lt;em&gt;collection&lt;/em&gt; didn’t serve as I thought it should according to my interpretation of the specifications. I’ll come back to that later, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One must accrue followers. That is, I’m not going to send blog entries arbitrarily out to fediverse entities. So, when someone follows Martenblog, it receives something along these lines to the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; (that’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/inbox):&quot;&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/inbox):&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Follow&quot;,
  &quot;object&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  &quot;id&quot;: &quot;https://sonomu.club/94904728-1d32-4a51-b422-0373323ec61c&quot;,

  &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;
  }&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The code takes this json and wraps it in an &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; activity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;{
  &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Accept&quot;,
  &quot;object&quot;: {
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;Follow&quot;,
    &quot;object&quot;: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,

  &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
and sends it on its way, which will be explained next, as it is the most complex bit. The &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; endpoint in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/router.ex&lt;/a&gt; sends the &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; activity to the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; function in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/activitypub.ex,&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/activitypub.ex,&lt;/a&gt; which calls the &lt;code&gt;accept&lt;/code&gt; function in the same file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Implementing the &lt;em&gt;sending an activity to another Fediverse server&lt;/em&gt; part was like excoriating myself with a rusty spanner, mainly because I couldn’t find a clear way to &lt;strong&gt;test&lt;/strong&gt; during development, so I was, as it were, programming blind, deaf, motionless and possibly without appendages whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def sign_and_send(activity, inbox) do
  target_domain = Fuzzyurl.from_string(inbox).hostname
  inbox_fragment = String.replace(inbox, &quot;https://#{target_domain}&quot;, &quot;&quot;)
  date_str = Utils.rfc2616_now 
  Logger.info &quot;Reading private key...&quot;
  {:ok, priv_key} = File.read(&quot;/home/polaris/keys/martenblog.pem&quot;)
  Logger.info &quot;priv_key: #{priv_key}&quot;
  string_to_sign = &quot;(request-target): post #{inbox_fragment}\nhost: #{target_domain}\ndate: #{date_str}&quot;
  [ rsa_entry | _ ] = :public_key.pem_decode(priv_key)
  decoded_key = :public_key.pem_entry_decode(rsa_entry)
  sign_me = :public_key.sign(string_to_sign, :sha256, decoded_key)
  signature = :base64.encode(sign_me)
  sig_header = &quot;keyId=\&quot;https://#{@domain}/ap/actor#main-key\&quot;,headers=\&quot;(request-target) host date\&quot;,algorithm=\&quot;rsa-sha256\&quot;,signature=\&quot;#{signature}\&quot;&quot;
  case Poison.encode activity do
    {:ok, json_activity} -&gt; 
      Logger.info &quot;sign_and_send -&gt; activity: #{json_activity}&quot;
      Logger.info &quot;string_to_sign: #{string_to_sign}&quot;
      Logger.info &quot;signature header: #{sig_header}&quot;
      Logger.info &quot;date_str: #{date_str}&quot;
      case :hackney.post(inbox, [
          Host: target_domain, 
          Date: date_str, 
          Signature: sig_header, 
          &quot;Content-Type&quot;: &quot;application/ld+json; profile=\&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\&quot;&quot;,
          Accept: &quot;application/activity+json, application/ld+json&quot; 
        ], json_activity) do
        {:ok, res} -&gt; res
        error -&gt; error
      end
    error -&gt; error
  end 
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This function is invoked with the activity to be sent and the inbox of its recipient. In this case, said recipient would be the &lt;em&gt;actor&lt;/em&gt; from another federated site that sent me a &lt;em&gt;follow&lt;/em&gt; activity. I extract the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; of the actor who wants to follow me by grabbing the actor and extracting its &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; field. The &lt;code&gt;remote_actor&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetch_actor&lt;/code&gt; functions do this. You may want to take a look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/ap_resolver.ex,&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/ap_resolver.ex,&lt;/a&gt; also, which handles actors cached in the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I diverged from the main point a bit. &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; receives the &lt;em&gt;activity&lt;/em&gt; to send and the &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt; of the remote actor to send it to. First, it calculates the &lt;code&gt;inbox_fragment&lt;/code&gt; from the remote &lt;em&gt;inbox&lt;/em&gt;. That’d be, say &lt;code&gt;/users/flavigula/inbox&lt;/code&gt;. Next, the date, which &lt;strong&gt;HAS&lt;/strong&gt; to be in this format: &lt;code&gt;Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&lt;/code&gt; - the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#page-124&quot;&gt;rfc2616&lt;/a&gt; format. If you do not use that format, you will instantly be beheaded. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It seems that Pleroma is more flexible concerning the format of the date it receives. Mastodon is not. It &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; be RFC2616. Take a look at the function &lt;code&gt;rfc2616_now&lt;/code&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/utils.ex.&quot;&gt;https://github.com/inhortte/martenblog-elixir/blob/master/lib/martenblog/utils.ex.&lt;/a&gt; Notice that I manually append GMT at the end. Since I use &lt;code&gt;DateTime.utc_now&lt;/code&gt;, the time zone is not relevant, but be warned that if you use a conversion tool that gives you &lt;code&gt;UTC&lt;/code&gt; as the time zone, your signature &lt;strong&gt;will be rejected by Mastodon servers&lt;/strong&gt;. Tacking on &lt;code&gt;GMT&lt;/code&gt; is my solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mastodon uses this bit of Ruby to verify the date:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;def matches_time_window?
  begin
    time_sent = Time.httpdate(request.headers[&apos;Date&apos;])
  rescue ArgumentError
    return false
  end
  (Time.now.utc - time_sent).abs &lt;= 12.hours
end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I recall reading that the &lt;em&gt;window&lt;/em&gt; for submitting a response is +/- 30 seconds. Obviously, Mastodon thinks otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Sometime before you get to this point, you need to have generated a public / private key pair. If you don’t know how to perform these duties, check out the following url: &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/.&quot;&gt;https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/.&lt;/a&gt; It also complements several processes I’ve already described, so is generally helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, Herr &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; fetches my private key and constructs the so called &lt;code&gt;string_to_sign&lt;/code&gt;, which his this aspect:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;(request-target): post /users/flavigula/inbox
host: sonomu.club
date: Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The function continues by decoding my private key, signing the key via &lt;em&gt;sha256&lt;/em&gt;, and encoding the result via &lt;em&gt;base64&lt;/em&gt;. Of course, the tools you use to perform these three steps will vary depending on your language. I’m hanging out with Elixir at the moment and the procedure is carried out by functions from the underlying Erlang system (note they all start with &lt;code&gt;:&lt;/code&gt;). The aforementioned &lt;em&gt;blog.joinmastodon.org&lt;/em&gt; url details the same steps in Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;sig_header&lt;/code&gt;, an amalgam of the preceeding steps, comes out similar to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;code&gt;keyId=”https://flavigula.net/ap/actor#main-key”,headers=”(request-target) host date”,algorithm=”rsa-sha256”,signature=”VHYpjLbjhxwsVwOQTPzsbzzSkqCHXRtnhUp3CYYJsXRcdosKAeSHKShm3OuwCLlyx7iLvsU7y+jN2i4zrf2nLfAi6ujXqUBxsfrtHXBaLkjMyypRZ6eYwprZvZsDgWQ0v+M1E2KsWowlLINpAWGG9Nydh4wCa37RB7sAhqv/Ccdp57FACT5O9DQFUccgko93Yns4Amo7ZWtKth0QAR4H5bILe8lLGa0E6IfgyX1SSuitXRMqVsd8RDPY9ARKUl7arge6mPNl9WFtxPjNzhfXIiEYn7VHIt1WA82ungMnNUy6+aOOrBwJWu8BDYOlZT+Sl5/qN91ggjjtgq7vT+qjrA==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now, you can &lt;em&gt;POST&lt;/em&gt; the activity to the foreign inbox. Again, I’m using Erlang - &lt;em&gt;hackney&lt;/em&gt; to be exact. Set the &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; to be &lt;code&gt;application/ld+json; profile=\”https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams\”&lt;/code&gt; or be beheaded once again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
On to sending actual blog entries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Wrapping an entry into an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#dfn-article&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, I get the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%{
  &quot;@context&quot;: [&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;],
  attributedTo: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  cc: [],
  content: &quot;&lt;p&gt;Strange how these days remind me...&lt;/p&gt;\n&quot;,

  published: &quot;Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&quot;,
  to: [&quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;],
  type: &quot;Article&quot;,
  url: &quot;https://flavigula.net/#/blog/2006/12/8&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
… constructed by the &lt;code&gt;article&lt;/code&gt; function in &lt;code&gt;activitypub.ex&lt;/code&gt;. Though I didn’t find reference to it in documentation anywhere (but I honestly didn’t look for more than twenty six seconds), the &lt;code&gt;url&lt;/code&gt; field provides a nice link using the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; at the beginning of an article federated to Pleroma. Mastodon ends up with the contents of the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; field followed by the url. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Elixir &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; (that’s the construction you see above that begins with &lt;code&gt;%{&lt;/code&gt; and ends with &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt; which is certaily not json yet) is piped through the &lt;code&gt;create_activity&lt;/code&gt; function and another &lt;em&gt;map&lt;/em&gt; emerges:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;%{
  &quot;@context&quot;: &quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;,
  actor: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor&quot;,
  cc: [],
  id: &quot;https://flavigula.net/ap/20a8f2d0-8f14-42bf-ab4f-c4d5a98c7c5a&quot;,
  object: %{
    # The article above
  },
  published: &quot;Thu, 26 Dec 2019 15:25:21 GMT&quot;,
  to: [&quot;https://sonomu.club/users/flavigula&quot;],
  type: &quot;Create&quot;
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I noted earlier, and also to prevent yourself from being beheaded a third time, make sure the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;em&gt;article&lt;/em&gt; (represented in the &lt;code&gt;object&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;em&gt;create activity&lt;/em&gt;), the &lt;code&gt;published&lt;/code&gt; field in the &lt;em&gt;create activity&lt;/em&gt; itself and the &lt;em&gt;date&lt;/em&gt; that goes into the &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; apparatus are &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; within thirty seconds of each other. Edit: The Ruby code I quoted above and which comes straight from the Mastodon source seems to think 12 hours is good enough. Regardless, playing it safe is better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Identical to sending the &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt; activity previously, this &lt;em&gt;create activity&lt;/em&gt;, along with &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; follower’s inbox goes to &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt;. I loop through each inbox, calling &lt;code&gt;sign_and_send&lt;/code&gt; repeatedly, and certainly realize this is not particularly efficient. I’ll get around to improving this and other laxnesses soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned near the beginning of this spiel, though, I could not get the &lt;em&gt;send to followers&lt;/em&gt; functionality of Activitypub to work. Therefore, instead of having &lt;code&gt;https://flavigula.net/ap/actor/followers&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;to&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;cc&lt;/code&gt; fields, I directly add an array of the followers’ inboxes. The issue needs more investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
So, there you have it. I possibly missed a few steps and / or parts are misaligned and inexact. Having stated that caveat, I hope what I’ve written is of help to some of those &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; I keep hearing about who are ostensibly wandering around on the face of the planet. If so, said &lt;em&gt;humans&lt;/em&gt; should relax, celebrate, take some ketamine or whatever suits their fancy. I know I would were I a &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; instead of a mere &lt;em&gt;mustelid&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Artifact that Diluted a Species</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to #music, any piece that doesn’t contain an underlying current of melancholy or a smattering of anxiety isn’t ever going to be regarded as &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; in my inked book. I consider the two emotions the basis of quality art, or, translated into more humble terms, &lt;em&gt;art that appeals to the inner goat&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I quickly lose interest in pieces that ooze what some would call &lt;em&gt;joy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;ecstasy&lt;/em&gt;. Their surface is too transparent. There is usually little beneath. Thus, &lt;em&gt;club&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;dance&lt;/em&gt; music, in the modern sense, doesn’t appeal to me. In fact, it fills me with a rage that teeters on the edge of genocidal mania. As far as &lt;em&gt;transparency&lt;/em&gt; goes, neither does folk music do much for &lt;em&gt;the inner goat&lt;/em&gt;. At times lyrics and melodies may pull on the hara’s firmament, but the inner emptiness of the music always overwhelms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An exception to the first paragraph is droning, mostly harmonically static, &lt;em&gt;ambient&lt;/em&gt; music. The deference to an emotionless morass is appealing to my cruder, Taoist sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My goal, apart from what I’ve typewritten with a hunk of dirt bashed against the skull of a goat, is to create &lt;em&gt;bare&lt;/em&gt; music. Its relation to &lt;em&gt;droning, mostly harmonically static&lt;/em&gt; music is most apparent in that it is not defined by any emotion that I, its creator, am oozing during the moment of creation (or any other moments in its temporal vicinity). Any #emotion conjured from a piece is incidental, created by the ooze of chemicals within the listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course, I have hopes that the primary emotion that surges from an active or passive listener is unbridled &lt;strong&gt;RAGE&lt;/strong&gt;. They transform into their interior &lt;strong&gt;GOAT&lt;/strong&gt; and viciously butt passerbys into metaphorical &lt;em&gt;cunetas&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The ostensible connotation is that none of my music will be, by my former definition, &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; in my inked book. In that my satisfaction is more with the journey of creating than in the finished product, I’m not bothered. My &lt;em&gt;goat hara&lt;/em&gt; is complex enough and infused with enough modular history that I’m sure a mixture of varying emotional material will flow into a piece no matter my intention. I’ll be the “judge” of whether anything is &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; later in life by the impressions the pieces leave on my later self.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Life Less Meaningful</title>

Yesterday, I asked Christián for his opinion of the percussion in a short piece I’d written for Dani’s short film. At one point, he asked me, &lt;strong&gt;What are you trying to accomplish?&lt;/strong&gt; I made up some bullshit about a statue of the Buddha with a pistol on a beach on the Baltic Sea, waves lapping at its base. A module in my collective mind reacted before my more mature modules could stop it. It feared that without an initial #narrative to back the piece of music up, the whole process was meaningless. Even after other #modules caught up, I didn’t back up and correct myself. Only later in the evening did I write something pertaining to my more mature thoughts on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From far back in my cultural education, I was progressively etched. If there is no compelling narrative as the impetus for a piece of #music, then it has no substance. Why? Why can’t a piece of art stand on its own without a story to back it? I respect Abstract Expressionists in this regard. And, in fact, for myriad works I have completed and are in the process of completion, no underlying narrative exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Many of my modules carry this cultural etching. The ones that do not, or on which the etchings are fading, become more and more dominant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think it is inevitable that for music humans bother to delve into, narratives are created, sourced from personal experiences and from emotions that surface during immersion. These pieces of art do not require an &lt;em&gt;initial&lt;/em&gt; narrative, though. No #meaning is necessary. They can be personal sounding boards. They can be spaces where reverberations create unique narratives.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Every Contextual Greyness Fading from an Edge You Are</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
What remains, in my mind, in the soundtrack to Dani’s newest short film, austerely entitled &lt;em&gt;Sheriff&lt;/em&gt;, is one more short piece. I’m not counting the two #SirAlfredIV remakes that still have to be done. Forcing Christián to sing &lt;em&gt;A House of Strength and Love&lt;/em&gt; will be a chore. Oh, he’ll sing it well and be willing, but he is anything but timely when collaborating on #music. His main problem, obviously, is that he has no access to Romanian Prostitutes in South Carolina (subsequently known as &lt;em&gt;The Pit&lt;/em&gt;). Being of the ignorant farmboy type, he’d not notice the &lt;em&gt;Guress Jewel&lt;/em&gt; inside each Romanian Prostitute, sense nothing of the underlying richness of &lt;em&gt;Elixir&lt;/em&gt; or its &lt;em&gt;regular expression syntax&lt;/em&gt;, and simply toss her to the dogs (or to his brother) after profaning her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Actally, Christián &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;em&gt;Sheriff&lt;/em&gt; in Dani’s newest short #film. And a fine sheriff he is, untimely imp or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The latest piece and the remaining one are both based on melodies I wrote for &lt;em&gt;Insensetez&lt;/em&gt;, the July tune in my Jazz course. The melodies are wholly original, though other parts of my arrangement were based on the original melody of the piece. As I showered earlier, I put on &lt;em&gt;Rain Tree Crow&lt;/em&gt; at a volume that created an ambience, as it should be. In specific, &lt;strong&gt;New Moon at Red Deer Wallow&lt;/strong&gt; struck me as the sort of environment I’d like. The pace is hollow. The synth rolls like moonbeams made to dapple a forest floor in vaguely geometic abstractions. The melody itself drifts in and out almost as if it were peeking occasionlly around a stone but mostly keeping to itself. I’ll keep this all in mind for my recitation (as Robert Calvert would say, were he not dispersed into the roots of various vegetables).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Meat Locker of Earlthly Desires</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The initial purpose of this entry is to test a new #blog functionality. An astute reader will notice the hash symbol in front of the word &lt;em&gt;blog&lt;/em&gt; in the previous sentence. After reading about the Linux / MacOS command line application &lt;em&gt;JRNL&lt;/em&gt;, I decided that dispensing with my ubiquitous &lt;em&gt;topic header&lt;/em&gt; shall be done today. The original format of these entries, all written in either &lt;em&gt;Emacs&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Vim&lt;/em&gt;, of course, since I am &lt;strong&gt;old school&lt;/strong&gt;, is a series of headers terminated by newlines. One of them is &lt;em&gt;Topic&lt;/em&gt;, after which is listed a comma delimited list of topics an entry pertains to. I’ve come to realize that being &lt;strong&gt;old school&lt;/strong&gt;, though attractive to all the Romanian Prostitutes roving these parts, isn’t always the ideal state of being. Indeed, the &lt;em&gt;ideal state of being&lt;/em&gt; is ever changing, or &lt;em&gt;progressive&lt;/em&gt;, if you will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Speaking of Romanian Prostitues, I’ve been made aware that they may be of help with #Elixir regular expresions. Growing up in Romania, especially in the cluttered berg of Deva, has its advantages, you see. Young girls are raised to be one thing or another. That’s an &lt;em&gt;inclusive&lt;/em&gt; or. The first, as the peruser of &lt;strong&gt;Martenblog&lt;/strong&gt; may have guessed, and given its references in this and the previous paragraph, is a &lt;em&gt;Romanian Prostitute&lt;/em&gt;. The second, as the peruser of &lt;strong&gt;Martenblog&lt;/strong&gt;, being swift in mental capacities, should have assumed by now, is a &lt;em&gt;Elixir Regular Expression Guress&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Guress&lt;/strong&gt; is the feminine of &lt;strong&gt;Guru&lt;/strong&gt;. As their male counterparts swelter on mountainsides and in Slivovice distilleries, these soon to be defouled innocents are schooled rigorously in both trades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Returning to the topic, absolutely no pun intended because I despise puns and find them the lowest, peasanty humour available, bubble-like and crude, is that a #hashtag in the body of an entry creates a topic much like the aforementioned comma delimited list. Now to test. Go fetch yourself a Romanian Prostitute.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Abandon My True Eidolon in Yonder Convenient Abyss</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/436.gmi</id>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Whilst chatting with Herr Neumann earlier today, I was reminded of something I used to think about often: Relationships fail when they begin with the partners pretending to be something other than they will be in every day life later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Christián’s current obsession with Isa reminds me of this truth - a truth that is evident when one steps outside of the circumstance. Many people go into the dating game, which is just a shortcut to saying &lt;em&gt;an entraceway into a romantic relationship&lt;/em&gt; acting utterly unlike they are in every day life. They try to impress. They take pains to cater to every need of the potential mate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When such a situation does develop into a routine, and then it escalates into living together, and then proceeds to other morbid rituals, the flashy sheen that was so apparent at the beginning of the &lt;em&gt;dating process&lt;/em&gt; fades - sometimes quickly. They are left with another human different from the eidolon they first encountered. Dissolution ensues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The most successuful relatioships I’ve seen began with the pair in situations mirroring their normal habits. They were part of the same group of friends, all knowing intimate details about each other, before romantic notions developed. Or, they worked together and saw many sides of one another before feelings escalated. Later in life, there are fewer surprises. Isa doesn’t disembowel Christián with a kitchen utensil when he begins spouting rubbish about how granting women equal rights was the beginning of the downfall of mankind, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is the Distance between Stagnant and Fossilized?</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/435.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/435.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Yesterday, as the baleful sun began its descent across the jagged horizon, I walked with Marisa along the dusty road to &lt;em&gt;Tres Aguas&lt;/em&gt;. She’s been preoccupied lately because one of her tenants in the apartment on &lt;em&gt;Madre de Dios&lt;/em&gt; has lost his job and thus is expelling himself from Logroño. Worry eats at her. She fixates on worry. It’s a genetic burr in her family, methinks. I doubt it can be removed and in any case, I’m done with trying to alter peoples’ personalities. That was the Bobbus of fifteen or more years ago. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
An aside:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Marisa just rose from her pained slumberous morning malaise to introduce me to the phrase &lt;em&gt;que te den morcilla&lt;/em&gt;, which is equivalent to &lt;em&gt;vete a la mierda&lt;/em&gt;. The phrase toots my muffin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The soon to be ex-tenant is a &lt;em&gt;lawyer&lt;/em&gt; of sorts, or has aspirations to be one, and of the &lt;em&gt;technology&lt;/em&gt; variety. I’m unsure if his knowledge of the ways of specific TCP and UDP ports on his laptop is profound, but I’m sure his heart is in the right place - that is, pumping circulatory fluid throughout his living corpse. Apparently, he wants to advise Spanish companies and individuals in EU law regarding various transactions across the internet. Somehow (I’m not completely clear on this point), his employer, another of these &lt;em&gt;lawyers&lt;/em&gt;, dismissed him from his position. This &lt;em&gt;jefe&lt;/em&gt; specializes in what the youth - I’ll call him &lt;em&gt;Aitor&lt;/em&gt; from here on out - aspires to. So he’s fucked, eh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m also not completely clear on the next point. To be placed in a &lt;em&gt;pool&lt;/em&gt; of humans who could be selected for a position given his credentials, an authority informed him that he has to have some sort of technology certification to accompany the pretty paper that declares him a &lt;em&gt;lawyer&lt;/em&gt;. He applied to a program in the University of La Rioja to take a degree / certificate / whatever of this sort and was &lt;strong&gt;rejected&lt;/strong&gt;. Universities in Spain have a limited number of &lt;em&gt;agujeros&lt;/em&gt; open in any given field of study. He was not inserted into one of said &lt;em&gt;agujeros&lt;/em&gt; because, I paraphrase, the &lt;em&gt;agujeros&lt;/em&gt; are reserved for humans who do not already hold another degree / certificate / whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Aitor has multiple paths from which he can now choose. Unfortunately for Marisa, none coincide with him being anything other than an ex-tenant. The central bulb of our communication yesterday sprang from my insistence that Aitor abandon attempts to find his passion in a small city / region like Logroño / La Rioja and migrate to Madrid or Barcelona, both hubs for tech activity in Spain. I regurgitated my repetitive theme to discard the hunt for university credentials and to forge one’s own path. Learning is a personal, intimate affair, especially in the realm of technologies. My experience certainly tells me so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Here we almost reached an impasse. I came up against the nearly impenetrable wall of Spanish &lt;em&gt;rootedness&lt;/em&gt;. She described to me what seemed like folklore but that she assured me still ran deep in Spanish mentality. &lt;strong&gt;The son who stays rooted in place and thus grows family fields into abundance is a success. He is rich. The son who departs onto paths leading him away from the home patch is a failure.&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously, this mentality doesn’t sit well with me. I have no want or need for roots. I am a spirit of the air, not of the earth. We did not hit an actual impasse because we both agreed that Aitor &lt;strong&gt;should&lt;/strong&gt; strike out if his intention is to explore all possibilities of “success”. Marisa is simply insistant that because of Spanish &lt;em&gt;rootedness&lt;/em&gt;, he is unlikely to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pegado.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The word is used often. A human is stuck to a place. A human is rooted to his past and to his surroundings. A human is likely only to search for possibilities within this bubble. A human is unlikely to stray outside of it. A human who does stray outside of it is regarded odd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The mentality isn’t unique to Spanish culture. It is a seed within all &lt;em&gt;pueblo&lt;/em&gt; culture, worldwide. Bubbles vary in sizes, of course, but they are always there. It touches on a duscussion that Monsieur Bender and I had time and again contrasting those who &lt;strong&gt;stay&lt;/strong&gt; within &lt;em&gt;pueblo&lt;/em&gt; culture to see it grow and those who &lt;strong&gt;flee&lt;/strong&gt; from a &lt;em&gt;pueblo&lt;/em&gt; culture to take seed in other parts (usually bringing along facets of the origin culture). Even in this simplification, a third option is obvious. Spirits of the air may not take seed &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;. They drift, finally never taking root in any locale except their tomb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The question the idea begs is this: Is it really important to take seed anywhere? Is it necessary? Or is it just &lt;em&gt;human nature&lt;/em&gt; or, further, &lt;em&gt;animal nature&lt;/em&gt; to biologically and psychologically repopulate one’s bubble? I feel no pressure to do so. I posit that it is a freedom that few have. Perhaps that is a lofty or elitist proclamation. Fuck um. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I mentioned, I’m finished with attempting to change peoples’ fundamental natures, so the case of Aitor is in his own hands. Actually, it’s most likely in the hands of not only Aitor, but of his family and closest friends - that is, the ones what make most of our decisions for us. Aitor’s bubble will make the descision for him. But, like Monsieur Bender and like myself, spirits of the air thrive in reduced, yet highly permeable bubbles. I shall continue to thrive in my own.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Ever Expanding Cage</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/434.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/434.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Perhaps the subject of this entry should be &lt;em&gt;An Ever Enveloping Cage&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;An Ever Expanding Cage&lt;/em&gt;. The latter, an unfortunate mistake that I could easily reach up and change with my agile cursor and typing skills but shall not since it would eliminate the need for this sentence, signifies the same as what scientists of the modern age bark when they refer to the &lt;em&gt;expansion of the universe&lt;/em&gt;. It’s stretchy. If my &lt;em&gt;cage&lt;/em&gt; is also stretchy, then it doesn’t move to accompany other philosophies, ideals and lumps of garbage left by so-called neighbours who have trundled along. No! It stretches like our universe, becoming &lt;em&gt;larger&lt;/em&gt; but keeping the same &lt;em&gt;contents&lt;/em&gt;. Its contextual surroundings never change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’d like to think that my mind is not &lt;em&gt;estrecho&lt;/em&gt; like that of a &lt;em&gt;pueblo-bound&lt;/em&gt; palurdo. I’d also like to think that as the universe &lt;em&gt;stretches&lt;/em&gt;, it becomes so diffuse that each of my neurons becomes an individual &lt;em&gt;Boltzmann Brain&lt;/em&gt;. Oh, they will, Herr Cynic! By that time, however, the stretch will have rendered the concept of &lt;em&gt;distance&lt;/em&gt; useless and each of those &lt;strong&gt;brains&lt;/strong&gt; will be its own universe, divorced from contact with any other. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ll start again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’d like to think that my mind is not &lt;em&gt;estrecho&lt;/em&gt; like that of a &lt;em&gt;pueblo-bound&lt;/em&gt; palurdo. An &lt;em&gt;expanding&lt;/em&gt; mind only becomes bloated on its own feces and beliefs. An &lt;em&gt;enveloping&lt;/em&gt; mind absorbs new concepts, has the ability to create abstractions between disperate elements of ideology, philosophy and culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This brings me to the primary topic of this entry. I appreciate art more when it is can be decontextualized without damaging its meaning. As a unit of art, it can stand apart and shine, like a &lt;em&gt;Boltzmann Brain&lt;/em&gt; out of contact with any other so-called sentient cloud of vapour. If, in other palmistry rites, an &lt;em&gt;obra&lt;/em&gt; is steeped in its context to the extent that it cannot be separated from it to be appreciated, it will be diminished for me. I will not appreciate it. It becomes a painting hung on the outer wall of a stone bubble. I have to travel to that bubble’s whereabouts, observe the lines and swirls, then enter the bubble itself and glean ideas about what’s going on inside, re-emerge, consider the coloured forms once again, possibly repeat, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think and deal in abstractions more and more as I inch towards decrepitude. One of my greatest ex-loves, lyrical and poetic forms, don’t entice me like they used to unless they are also floating in an abstract mist. Specifics ruin the experience. I used to be a big fan of musical storytelling. I was into Harry Chapin and such ilk. Perhaps my &lt;em&gt;ever enveloping cage&lt;/em&gt; has enveloped too much. To appreciate art, I wish its context dismissed. I realize that is more difficult with narrative oriented poetry / lyrics. Thus, I distance myself from them. I float in an abstract mist. Music, being a more abstract form itself than language, fares better for me when its context is not immediately apparent or if it is a hybrid of many contexts all referring to one another in complex ways. When it can only be appreciated fully within one of the aforementioned stone bubbles, it’s not going to get my attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For me, art that has to be contextualized for appreciation is not &lt;em&gt;arte puro&lt;/em&gt;. It cannot transcend its origins. I have to use a modifyer to name it accurately - &lt;em&gt;folk art&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;pop art&lt;/em&gt;, or whatever. The age of complete decontextualization shall come, and it will be &lt;em&gt;beauty puro&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Menhir of Pueblo Culture</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/433.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/433.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I once wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
Regularity and routine and especially in the same small town makes memory monolithic, blurring similar situations from diverse times - the dragonflies tell me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Dragonflies are known to be cerebral creatures, especially in pueblos dotted with drying puddles of foreign interference. The footprints of travellers fade quickly. Memory remains monolithic, steeped in cultural immobility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
These days, I find regularity and routine to be tools to various ends. My music making’s graph that was flatlined for years, or even decades, has taken on a mountainous nature once again. Regularity and routine are culprits in this enterprise. When I wrote the above quote, however, I was an observer of the quiet circular stitches made by the inhabitants of Seminole, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Monolithic memory in a way is like sedimentary stone. Layer upon layer are piled and atop is the &lt;em&gt;culture&lt;/em&gt;. It’s also unlike sedimentary stone because the lowest layers still permeate the nature of those more exposed to the air. They both &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;invade&lt;/em&gt; anything that builds upon them. They are despotic bastards. But aren’t all cultural mores, in a sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Monolithic cultural memory also inflicts what I call &lt;em&gt;hearsay knowledge&lt;/em&gt; upon inhabitants that roam atop the outermost layer. &lt;em&gt;Hearsay knowledge&lt;/em&gt; is in contrast with &lt;em&gt;common knowledge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;fundamental knowledge&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a set of customs and &lt;em&gt;old wives tales&lt;/em&gt; based on myths and traditions. Some may scrape truths and realities in a shallow sense, but most are followed simply by sheer force of their cultural history. Examples would be closing the closet door before gonig to sleep at night or never placing a hot dish in a modern refrigerator. Both cannot be verified to be &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; in our modern age. The first springs from childhood fears, solidifies into unthinking habit. The second was moderately realistic at some point in the past, but has no bearing on recent appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The pueblo mind and its monolithic memory is slow to change, almost immobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In contrast to &lt;em&gt;hearsay knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;common knowledge&lt;/em&gt; is a grey area between easily proven facts (given our current technological and scientific state) and pure myth. It varies from culture to culture, though there normally is overalp. It varies more widely between &lt;em&gt;bubbles&lt;/em&gt;. The group of friends I had in university and beyond (Tony, Jayson, Jeff, Christopher …) had a more erudite &lt;em&gt;common knowledge&lt;/em&gt; than the fratboy &lt;em&gt;‘sgitabeer&lt;/em&gt; types down the hall, though their &lt;em&gt;common knowledge&lt;/em&gt; may have had facets we were unaware of, as well, to play the fucking &lt;em&gt;abogado del diablo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As an aside, it was always thrilling to find other small cultural bubbles (that I usually called &lt;em&gt;shibboleths&lt;/em&gt;) that were regionally or socially disconnected but shared these erudite &lt;em&gt;common knowledges&lt;/em&gt;. Bonding was usually quicker, like with the social groups I found in Praha after my eternal exile from the states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Hearsay knowledge&lt;/em&gt;, in spite of its kinship with astrological, starry-eyed pseudo-religious &lt;strong&gt;hovno&lt;/strong&gt;, does provide an almost endless wellspring for fictional interpretation. In fact, the impetus of this journal entry was my perusal after over a decade of Lovecraft’s tales. He took primal &lt;em&gt;hearsay knowledge&lt;/em&gt; from recessed, haunted cultural memory and costructed a vivid, frightening universe. Most &lt;em&gt;common knowledges&lt;/em&gt; state to not take such stories at face value. I’d imagine, however, even given their extreme, fantastical nature, there exist peasants who do.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Kant was very specific about the difference between a &lt;em&gt;Phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;Noumenon&lt;/em&gt;. The perception of sonic information creates the &lt;em&gt;phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; of music. I find this an initially clear view of the dichotomy. One could name the waves buzzing from my near field monitors the &lt;em&gt;noumena&lt;/em&gt;, but they lack interpretation. To confound the issue, an oscilloscope, though distant from intelligent machines to come, interprets these &lt;em&gt;noumena&lt;/em&gt; quite differently than our brains. The sensory apparatus of the machine is not unlike our eardrums, but the brain of the machine translates incoming waves into organized vector graphs. This &lt;em&gt;phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; itself is a &lt;em&gt;noumenon&lt;/em&gt; on a different level. Our eyes interpret it into a different &lt;em&gt;phenomenon&lt;/em&gt; - that is, a representation of a sound wave as we know it with light. In this sense, there are endless tiers of &lt;em&gt;phenomena&lt;/em&gt; interpreted from &lt;em&gt;noumena&lt;/em&gt;. Is there a base &lt;em&gt;noumenon&lt;/em&gt; from which all springs? I’d like to believe it’s an infinite recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

I mention to other humans from time to time that I dislike capitalism. I hold it in high disdain, actually, for its abhorrent nature. Asshole capitalists. Let them rot in a molten, golden soup. Some humans often shoot back at me something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;well, you are selling your wares for money, too, so you are a capitalist&lt;/em&gt;. Either they are sealed in their own fundamentalist bubble so they cannot see the context of my existence or they outright refuse to believe that anything other than their own point of view exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Of course I &lt;em&gt;sell my wares for money&lt;/em&gt;. I have to survive in the society that contains us. Ideals exist that I may pine for, but I do not simply abandon everything to pursue them. As much as capitalist scum want a free for all, our occidental world is one of compromise, not of extremes. I &lt;em&gt;sell my wares for money&lt;/em&gt; but I don’t jump at the chance to monetize every grain that grows from the bosom of my brain or hara. We are all somewhere on an axis, not at an &lt;em&gt;chuck everything and live an ideal&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;submit to the capitalist free for all&lt;/em&gt; extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Axis thinking. Brian Eno wrote about it in his novel. I’ve talked about it for decades. I’m sure we are not the only ones. Consider it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Decaying in Sweet Dissonance</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/430.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/430.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://phys.org/news/2016-07-music-musical-cultural-hardwired-brain.html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; article is one of many that claim that consonance and dissonance are cultural traits. Exposure to western music has trained most of us to veer towards perfect fifths and similar rot. Perfect fifths have their place, of course, but just not in the helpings that I’m usually presented. This concept of &lt;strong&gt;subjective&lt;/strong&gt; evaluation of music bothers some people, especially those of the fundamentalist strain. I’m using the word &lt;em&gt;fundamentalist&lt;/em&gt; in a broader sense than usual, indicating any who have steadfast points of views not easily swayed by counter-evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Our hearing apparati has jointly evolved in a uniform way, so on a physical level, we perceive sound equally. We differ in the way our brain interprets and &lt;em&gt;sorts&lt;/em&gt; it. Brains love to categorize. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I grew up fully exposed to western music. Moreover, the &lt;em&gt;western music&lt;/em&gt; I was mostly exposed to as a &lt;strong&gt;youth&lt;/strong&gt; was a very narrow slice of all that was available in the occidental realm. The &lt;em&gt;western music&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;West Texas&lt;/strong&gt; was, as you might  guess, &lt;strong&gt;western music&lt;/strong&gt;! The plodding one two of country was my introduction to a universe that envelops most of my waking and dreaming thoughts. My uncle was the only &lt;em&gt;outsider&lt;/em&gt; in this respect, as I got a good dose of Baroque and Renaissance classical when I was in his presence when no-one was complaining about the &lt;em&gt;racket&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My penchance for outsider tonalities surely has its roots in the rejection of my upbringing and the atmosphere surrounding it, though I’ve never disgarded western tonality wholly and probably never will. Working within its vastness will satisfy me for epochs to come, for I can contintue to harvest the partially abandoned corners of its sonority. On that note, I shall add some B flatness over a percolating F#m6 arpeggio.&lt;/p&gt;

Dani tasked me with writing the sountrack to his new short film &lt;strong&gt;Sheriff&lt;/strong&gt;. I’d’ve picked a less mundane name, but it’s his project and I only assist, not interfere. My idea is to create a series of 9 - 12 miniatures between one and two and a half minutes each. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;
Thus the complication arrives.&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
My sense of musical movement is been set in gear that spins cogs at a glacial pace. I’m listening to &lt;em&gt;Possible Planet&lt;/em&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;Steve Roach&lt;/strong&gt; as I type and imagine he’d have the same problem that I have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The first miniature is based on an improvisation called &lt;em&gt;Suckin Down the Opium&lt;/em&gt; which sprang raw from my hara a few days back. It’s a solo, stark and bleak, over an F#m6 arpeggio. I used the &lt;em&gt;Condor&lt;/em&gt;‘s overdrive into my usual double &lt;em&gt;Brothers&lt;/em&gt; boost (the initial with tone ascended into the ionosphere and the second with tone descended into the lithosphere), which adds to the spontaneous, raw vibe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Anyone who isn’t an insect scurrying about my balcony at this moment will know that my improvisations tend to meander. &lt;em&gt;Suckin Down the Opium&lt;/em&gt; meandered less than most, but still tended to draw itself out towards a blurred horizon. The &lt;em&gt;miniature&lt;/em&gt;, now conditionally titled &lt;em&gt;He Lumbers Forward&lt;/em&gt;, for reasons already stated, cannot do that. The goal is to capture the lolling feel of the improvisation in two minutes, roughly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m disappointed with results so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Patter of Envelope Controlled White Noise Generators</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/428.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/428.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The first &lt;em&gt;mid-hump&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Dobruška and her Piglet&lt;/strong&gt; (since, as I mentioned in a previous entry, Dobruška is certainly not a dromedary), gave me problems for epochs upon epochs. I used recapitulations of themes, new themes, lack of themes, and ululating white noise for the section, all of which resulted in jarring transitions on both of its borders. Inspiration finally struck last Sunday, which should be ever celebrated in the future as the day that Flamenco humped Dobruška. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Christian, who I consider a fetid lump of homunculous meat, told me that his Flamenco instructor, José, suggested I add a &lt;em&gt;pad&lt;/em&gt; to some acoustic doodling he wrote. He sent me two files detailing the task. I found José’s fumblings pleasant and transcribed them into one of the handy spiral notebooks of blank sheet music that occupy one of the littered surfaces in my studio. Instead of immediately beginning to add &lt;em&gt;pads&lt;/em&gt; to these fumblings (I’m not a fan of the word &lt;em&gt;pad&lt;/em&gt; referring to a synthesizer drone beneath other musical movements), I realized that I could translate and mutate the ideas to another realm - namely the first &lt;em&gt;mid-hump&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;Dobruška and her Piglet&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
José’s ditty is in F# lydian, or that is the vista from which I view it. The only idea I retained from the original &lt;em&gt;mid-hump&lt;/em&gt; sketches was that the section was portioned into &lt;em&gt;d&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;e&lt;/em&gt;, raising the tonal center a major second halfway through. I mangled the original idea enough to make it my own, imply earlier and later themes, and 7/8-ify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Strangely, the first &lt;em&gt;mid-hump&lt;/em&gt; was written in 6/8, but clearly accented in 7/8. My mind had obviously been trecherous during the initial phases of inscribing the paths through Dobruška’s abstract thicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m satisfied with the results, though I cannot play the &lt;em&gt;Flamenco Travesty&lt;/em&gt; part (as I call it) sufficiently smoothly yet. During the process, I asked myself a few times where the vague line might be between inspiration and plagiarism. I’m of the mind that in this case, clearly the former. I could toss a line into the credits reading &lt;em&gt;Gracias a José, Herr Flamenquist, por inspirarme&lt;/em&gt;. Aunque, even were a trained marmot to listen to both back to back, he’d only find cursory similarity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Though, considering it, wouldn’t I have to also toss lines in to the credits to the effect of &lt;em&gt;Thanks to Daniel Denis / Dmitri Shostakovich / Brian Eno / Robert Wyatt / etc …&lt;/em&gt; for the multitudinous pieces they inspired? The &lt;strong&gt;Grand Marmot&lt;/strong&gt; who is clearly the tribunal for plagiaristic suspicions lands me clearly on the &lt;em&gt;inspiration&lt;/em&gt; side of that vague line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And, most importantly, I used ululating white noise as a backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>My Dirigible is the Centre of the Universe</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It’s a wonderful world - it’s a real crying shame&lt;/em&gt; croons David Sylvian as I begin the short journey from one end of a dense thicket to another. The thicket, or, in other words, this entry, is as yet only vaguely known, as it should be. The process reminds me of my &lt;em&gt;compositional strategy&lt;/em&gt; over the last three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
What &lt;em&gt;strategy&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt;, Herr Underling?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Like a savage thicket, or &lt;em&gt;woods&lt;/em&gt; if you are of the more civilized ilk, pieces of music appear in my mental landscape amorphous and untamed. Initially, entrances into the morass are simply dents into its wild tangles. I begin to hack a path, uprooting and pruning until it is navigable, or at least navigable to an extent. I retreat and begin from another point on the parameter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Were I to ascend in a dirigible from somewhere in the outskirts from time to time to observe my cuttings, splicing and replantings, I’d see the thatch slowly transforming from an abstraction of overlapping greens and browns into something that resembles one of those &lt;em&gt;hedge labyrinths&lt;/em&gt; you learned about from those naughty intellectual books your parents had squirreled away in one of their recessed shelving assemblies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Every time I’d gaze down from my sleek, agile dirigible, I’d have to accustom myself to a the new configuration of slightly repostured paths and recoulored floral arrangements. I am victim to &lt;em&gt;familiarity’s bane&lt;/em&gt;. What I hear (or see) again and again begins to be &lt;strong&gt;correct&lt;/strong&gt;. I make my notes as I listen (or see), regardless. I &lt;strong&gt;DIE&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless, or perhaps a &lt;em&gt;portion&lt;/em&gt; of me dies when the &lt;strong&gt;correctness&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; is torsioned. I finally move on to the new &lt;strong&gt;correctness&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a specific example, I rerecorded the second &lt;strong&gt;hump&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Dobruška and her Piglet&lt;/em&gt; during the last few days. I call it the second &lt;strong&gt;hump&lt;/strong&gt; because Dobruška is certainly not a &lt;em&gt;dromedary&lt;/em&gt;. Though the original branches, twigs, twisting paths and scattered leaves of this part was played sloppily, my obdurate mind still held to its essence as I observed my new cuttings. Perceiving the vague line between the &lt;em&gt;familiarity bane&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;personal quality&lt;/em&gt; is no task for a ploughless peasant.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Appease your own Gods</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/426.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/426.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I perused an article this morning. I won’t mention the source to that article since it won’t be around any longer after the &lt;strong&gt;heat death of the universe&lt;/strong&gt;, during which most of you will be reading this, when my writings become the only remaining &lt;strong&gt;literature&lt;/strong&gt; that gives that &lt;strong&gt;warm&lt;/strong&gt; feeling that harkens back to the &lt;strong&gt;olden days&lt;/strong&gt;: the days to which we should return. Lap up the words, serfs, as you grovel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The article concerned &lt;strong&gt;traditionalists&lt;/strong&gt;. That’s not the word the article used, but it is more precise concerning these soon (I use that word very loosely) to be &lt;strong&gt;scriptures&lt;/strong&gt;. Said humans find a fixed point in history and dub it &lt;strong&gt;holy&lt;/strong&gt;. This fixed &lt;strong&gt;point&lt;/strong&gt;, of course, can be any arbitrary stretch of time, as long as its pervading ruleset is vaguely the same. I’ll call the personification of that ruleset the &lt;strong&gt;sovereign&lt;/strong&gt;. Traditionalists derive their sense of ethics from this abstract ruler, as peasants did once from their &lt;strong&gt;king&lt;/strong&gt; in feudal times. Progressive thinking and modernism are tossed into the bin without thought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One must stay &lt;strong&gt;static&lt;/strong&gt; and obey the &lt;strong&gt;scripture&lt;/strong&gt; penned by the &lt;strong&gt;sovereign&lt;/strong&gt;. The rigidity provides a stable framework. There is no room for ethical fluidity or evolution, as distorting said &lt;strong&gt;scripture&lt;/strong&gt; makes no sense to the constricted mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Bubbles with thick membranes contain militant traditionalists. Their world is insulated. Their &lt;strong&gt;scripture&lt;/strong&gt; is law. Their ethics extends to bubble members only. Those outside are held in suspicion, like a mustelid at a fowl convention. A common dilemma is the reduced bubble and its rigid ethics, breeding sociopaths. The article didn’t go into it, but I can imagine that minimal bubbles with impermeable surfaces can have succinct, inked &lt;strong&gt;scriptures&lt;/strong&gt;. Indelible scriptures. A larger bubble and more permeable  membranal wall reduces sociopathy, promotes altruism and the idea that it’s maybe a good idea to return that wallet you found in the gutter, even a wallet with 2500&amp;euro; tastily banked inside, and even a wallet with a snapshot of an immigrant Pakistani family sitting beside the cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Exploratory minds don’t follow the will of &lt;strong&gt;sovereigns&lt;/strong&gt;. And don’t be fooled by the artist that wants to reproduce the &lt;strong&gt;sound&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;look&lt;/strong&gt; of those that peaked during the time of the &lt;strong&gt;sovereignty&lt;/strong&gt; he worships. On an abstract level, he only lives, ethically and creatively, during the reign of that bygone epoch. Don’t trust him. In fact, kick him into the gutter. Break his nose and fingers while you’re at it. Cut out his kidneys and dine on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
Ritual appeals to conformists and conformists perpetuate ritual. The idea that &lt;em&gt;everything goes as planned&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;everyone behaves in a predictable manner&lt;/em&gt; is another facet of familiarity. It is tied with safety. Within a cultural bubble, a &lt;em&gt;safe&lt;/em&gt; form of art is a form of art that stays within boundaries predefined by years of repitition. The art itself is a ritual. All improvisation must remain within the boundaries. Whilst arbitrary boundaries themselves can be used to help an artist approach material with a fresh perspective, boundaries set by endless &lt;em&gt;ritual&lt;/em&gt; are far more restrictive. They create opacity in the membrane of the bubble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The inhabitants of the bubble become an isolated village. Their artistic ritual is a cult where any outsider who wants to be a part must conform rigidly to strictures or be rejected, or at least endlessly corrected. There is only one way and it is the right way. It reminds me frighteningly of dogmatic religion, another bubble cult formed from ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve seen this phenomena especially in folk musics, though it’s certainly alive in other arenas. The ritual, over time, defines what is &lt;em&gt;puro&lt;/em&gt; for the music. Deviation creates tarnished bastardizations. Hybrids are smirked at. Of course, the village inhabitants are brought closer by this &lt;em&gt;puro&lt;/em&gt;. In fact, it enforces the sense of community. When the comet wipes out the rest of the species, this village will be happy alone with their &lt;em&gt;puro&lt;/em&gt;. On different levels of abstraction, every village is prone to this &lt;strong&gt;centricism&lt;/strong&gt;. Those that manifest &lt;strong&gt;centricism&lt;/strong&gt; in art have an opportunity to preach their version of &lt;em&gt;puro&lt;/em&gt; to those outside the bubble, to those willing to be indoctrinated. I view this as a manner of releasing said &lt;em&gt;puro&lt;/em&gt; into the wild so it can be hybridized with other forms. In the case of music, it can by hybridized with other rhythms, melodic ideas, and harmonic structures. The village elders will not be pleased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Artistic egoism?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Purists are ridiculous just from the fact that every connotation of &lt;em&gt;puro&lt;/em&gt; both the same (abstractly) and different (specifically), and the majority of village inhabitants either don’t realize it or simply reject it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The same idea is to never learn a word of a foreign tongue though the world is populated with them. Hybridizations in all things are seeds of evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ever a slave to the worn out grooves</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/424.gmi</id>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I talked with the gypsy loving douchebag Christián yesterday briefly about my dislike of &lt;strong&gt;noodling&lt;/strong&gt; and how musical structures that only serve as a receptacle for guitar (or any other instrument) improvisation aren’t really to my taste. I prefer when the structure, or harmonic, rhythmic and melodic &lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt; of a piece is on the altar and all instrumental parts serve to enhance its body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
When a body of work as vast as a &lt;em&gt;folk&lt;/em&gt; music exists, such as flamenco, I always pause to worder why there is so little variation in &lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt;. There is also very little variation in &lt;em&gt;timbre&lt;/em&gt;. This leads me to believe that it is music that is so tied to the public’s expectations that it is immobile. The musicians themselves may only sense it unconciously. Their choice of musical calling is a &lt;em&gt;folk tradition&lt;/em&gt; and should stay within various boundries. Perhaps they’d never voice it in that manner. It’d remain unconcious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I sense a connection with the idea of &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;, or at least &lt;em&gt;security&lt;/em&gt;. On the whole, humans tend towards cultural mores that bring the sensation of safety and familiarity. The &lt;strong&gt;raiz&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;em&gt;familiarity&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;family&lt;/em&gt; is the same. Gravitatino towards family has always been a bane of the species. No matter the consequence - family first. No matter the consecquence - familiarity first. The consequence here is that a musical &lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt; ossifies. By &lt;strong&gt;form&lt;/strong&gt;, I mean rhythmic and harmonic structure. Anything departing from the structure is no longer regarded as a part of said &lt;em&gt;folk art&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One shouldn’t shake the tree! An acorn might fall and impale your skull! Worse yet, it may fall to the ground, inter itself, mutate and grow into something altogether different and beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Ossified &lt;strong&gt;forms&lt;/strong&gt; cannot hold my interest over time. Creative modules within me understand what can and could be done &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; an ossified form, and intellectually, I appreciate those possibilities. However, &lt;em&gt;stronger&lt;/em&gt; creative modules within me ask &lt;em&gt;Why not variate the rhythm suddenly for a few bars?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Why always lead into the same cadence?&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Let’s add an electric cello in this part.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wouldn’t a drone in this section add atosphere? You are playing the same two chords over and over, anyway.&lt;/em&gt; And so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Paletos&lt;/em&gt; flee from under the shaking tree. They sense foundations being uprooted. They claw towards the tried and true. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The muddy sound of fluid frequencies</title>

    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
I’m listening to &lt;strong&gt;Shambal Lies Supine Part 2&lt;/strong&gt; on Musicoin, as I have submitted it to a &lt;em&gt;contest&lt;/em&gt;. I laughingly call it a contest, as Robert Calvert laughingly called one of his songs an &lt;strong&gt;enunciation&lt;/strong&gt; or somesuch. I predict a maximum of seven people (or groups) entering the contest and the winner not being &lt;strong&gt;Flavigula&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Flavigula&lt;/strong&gt; should win, however, not because I am vainglorious, but because in contrast to the other music that will be submitted, &lt;strong&gt;Shambal Lies Supine Part 2&lt;/strong&gt; will stand out. It will be unique. Listeners will either scratch their twin bovine heads or decrease the volume to background levels. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reminded by Calvert’s announcement on a live album that I don’t own anymore, I downloaded a bootleg from the Hype tour. The quality is atrocious. I’ll deal with it as long as possible. He’s chattering now about something. When the talk ends and the music starts is the moment all is considered. Before, only jabber. After, trancendence or planar death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Back to &lt;strong&gt;Shambal Lies Supine Part 2&lt;/strong&gt;, I consider my involment, cursory as it is, with &lt;em&gt;Atom Collector Records&lt;/em&gt;. Like all musical communities, to an extent, it is a &lt;strong&gt;bubble&lt;/strong&gt;. The membrane is quite permeable, however, and my &lt;em&gt;entry&lt;/em&gt; was simple. I was accomodated. The main proprietor even played a Flavigula track on his Sunday radio show. &lt;strong&gt;Organic Influence&lt;/strong&gt;, it was. I retraced the conversation in the chat room when my composition settled in the earcups of the five or six listeners. I boil the comments down to a single term: &lt;strong&gt;trippy&lt;/strong&gt;. Ok. That’s fine. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m certain that multitudinous music community &lt;strong&gt;bubbles&lt;/strong&gt; exist online, bringing together arbitrary and otherwise disconnected people and their disparate musics. They are musically heterogeneous but (mostly) humanly homogeneous. This contrasts musical &lt;strong&gt;bubbles&lt;/strong&gt; like Christián’s sacred Flamenco &lt;strong&gt;bubble&lt;/strong&gt; in Jerez, which is musically homogeneous and more humanly heterogeneous, though i suspect not too much. The focus is the music stylistically. The gypsy scum give lessons, perform barbaric rituals they call &lt;em&gt;performances&lt;/em&gt;, and snort cocaine. In contrast, the &lt;em&gt;Atom Collector Record&lt;/em&gt; crew are interested in two things only: 1. The acceptance of their music, whatever genre it may be, and it’s semi-distribution. 2. Jabbering about as most small communities do. #2 is less of a concern to me, as the topics, when they drift from &lt;strong&gt;music&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/strong&gt;, are trivial small talk, the jabber of &lt;strong&gt;paletos&lt;/strong&gt;. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I added &lt;strong&gt;routine&lt;/strong&gt; to the topics of this entry, so I suppose I should add something about the subject before I sign off to do something productive with my time, such as send anonymous packets of strychnine to arbitrary gypsy scum in the south. The only creative routine I currently have is going through daily jazz lessons, performing them, modifying them and using ideas for raw ideas that sometimes become parts of my own compositions. What I should do is invent a series of exercises to perform every morning. These could be scales, arpeggios, triad contortions or rhythmic training rituals that supercede anything a gypsy scum could come up with. The problem is to not get stuck into any set routine, but allow it to evolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Consider the alternative: sit and watch the membrane of any chosen &lt;strong&gt;bubble&lt;/strong&gt; become so thick one can no longer see out, much less exit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preforations in the Partition of Tradition</title>
    <id>gemini://thurk.org/blog/422.gmi</id>
    <link href="gemini://thurk.org/blog/422.gmi"/>
    <summary>&lt;p&gt;
The type of art that has appealed to me since my days living parched and shackled in a hovel in West Texas has always been the art of the outlier. The origin of this affinity is only semi-clear. I obviously had no love for my shackles. I obviously had no love for the conservative bubble my parents constructed around me. I obviously had no love for the lack of preforations in that bubble. There were a few preforations, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I didn’t consciously turn to outlier art, and especially outlier music. It seemed to seek me out. Or, rather, it had symbiosis with my sense of aesthetic. Again, from where came that sense of aesthetic? I obviously had no love for my shackles, etc. One always must question the environment presented as &lt;em&gt;normality&lt;/em&gt;. I see traditionalist art, and especially traditionalist music, as music is my chosen art form, as a pillar to the obstinate past and a barrier to progress. I tend to appreciate a dollop of it, but usually around the edges of the pillar. Yes - the edge cases - those bordering on parting from the pillar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The case for learning the traditional arts, or at least about them, resonates with me, especially as a cretin who creates his own art. To dart around a pillar, one has to know the dimensions of the pillar. Pillars are, after all, nasty momenuments to stagnation. Thump at the edge cases and watch them crumble into the &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt; of blackness. Let the particles swirl and coelesce again into different monstrosities, even mingling from the dust of edge cases from other pillars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Deconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But with different intent and form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
It follows that I object to bowing to hierarchies. Gender roles are preforated. Wealth structures crumble. They mingle in the black &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt; to become newer visages. Those will crumble yet again in some not too distant future. Fuck um. Therefore I don’t see the point in arguing for or against any established manner of conduct, class or mapping. Only the outliers floating in the &lt;em&gt;chaos&lt;/em&gt; and said pillars’ crumbling edge cases really appeal to me. Standing up for or standing against said pillars can be the eternal debate of others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Now it’s time to work of my twisted deconstruction of &lt;em&gt;Take the A Train&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Horrors of a Sunspot Winking Out</title>

A friendship only on one of the participants terms isn’t a friendship at all, actually, but more like a business contract. Anyone familiar with my blog entries will know that I am not the biggest fan of &lt;strong&gt;business contracts&lt;/strong&gt;. They reek of artificiality. They are the stagnant film on the surface of relationship’s pond. Fuck um.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
As I grow ancient, I notice more and more &lt;strong&gt;friendships&lt;/strong&gt; that edge closer and closer to said contracts. My initial impressions of reasons edge towards knowing people becoming more conservative as time goes by. Playing it more safe. There can no longer be as much &lt;strong&gt;fucking around&lt;/strong&gt; with time. Perhaps it is a symptom of middle age crises. I only know that I have not yet fallen victim to viewing friendships as a type of contract. As a type of stench coating a ostensibly deeper pond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I type &lt;strong&gt;yet&lt;/strong&gt; because I may fall into that morass, converting myself to a two dimensional film. I write this in hopes of rereading and remembering not to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
One obvious evidence is when someone places so-called friends into roles. In the mind of the person who sees people as contracts, he / she / it becomes a sort of &lt;strong&gt;Master of Ceremonies&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;director&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;playwright&lt;/strong&gt;. During the course of a &lt;strong&gt;meeting&lt;/strong&gt;, his &lt;strong&gt;friends&lt;/strong&gt; are characters, each having specific roles, and each walking a narrow path - that bath being his / her / its part. Deviating even slightly from that path perturbs the &lt;strong&gt;Master of Ceremonies&lt;/strong&gt;. He / she / it feels a loss of control. He / she / it feels a breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’m illustrating an extreme of the phenomenon, of course. But, &lt;strong&gt;think&lt;/strong&gt;. We’ve all seen it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Another point of view is that of balance. Every relationship has a tipping point where the grey becomes more obscure - where transparency finally fails. I try seeing from this viewpoint, as well. Basically, one or both parties have traversed differing roads and become less and less capabale of tolerating what they see as the other’s &lt;strong&gt;hovno&lt;/strong&gt;. The easiest is to part ways. More fulfilling, however, could be to try cease from judgment and love the other for who he / she / it is, frustrating as it might be. Maybe the balance is not a one dimensional measure, after all. Re-clarifying greys are multidimensional tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I’ve been trying to escape judgmental people since my childhood. My deathly pueblo &lt;strong&gt;Fort Stockton&lt;/strong&gt; was filled with them. I succeeded for a years, basking in friendships that, as Christián would say, were &lt;strong&gt;puro&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of the old despair is eking its way back into my life, however. I touch on it because ignoring the &lt;strong&gt;phenomenon&lt;/strong&gt; would be disaster in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
