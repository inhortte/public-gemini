So now comes the best song by this band, the band I have loved for years and years. They should know it.

A joy comes. Truth. Love of song is immortal.

An infant with the voice of a crone<br /> In Nebachanezar's parking zone<br /> Calls out my lord... your end is nigh<br /> I didn't mean to make you cry<br /> In deserts where the dust storm blows<br /> And lush black swamps where mandrake grows<br /> We're marching, laughing to the drum<br /> Waiting for those kings to come<br /> The circus sun in Nero eyes<br /> The lions and the Christians rise<br /> Software sings and hardware hears<br /> We're destined babe to live these years

Fucking excellent.
