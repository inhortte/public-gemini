# Your ex's snatch will gobble your soul

Whilst riding a bicycle today from *Viidu* to *Kihelkonna* and **back**, I glanced time and again at the simple, three gear shifting mechanism on the right handle bar, trying to shake a pricking notion from my head. It finally came to me exactly what the bothersome twinge was. It was *Brynn*. After fourteen years, the cunt's shenanigans still throb in my subconscious.

Her refusal of technology was mind-numbing. It was unfathomable to anyone who didn't personally encounter her. They sound like a ludicrous and frightful bedtime story for ogre pups. She wouldn't even shift gears on her bicycle.

*What?*

She wouldn't even shift gears on her 20 gear bicycle. She refused to do it. To her, doing so would be giving in to something unnatural, an alien force, a science or technology. And if you called her on it or something similar (there were all to many similar occurrences), you could have been sure that hades would unleash a fantastic array of demons on your unprepared psyche. I hope my reader is aware of the irony in this tale.
