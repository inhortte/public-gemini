I woke up this morning clutching my penis. Strange because I did not have any sexual dreams. I dreamt about Fort Stockton, as I usually do, but of a surreal Fort Stockton. I walked along what I suppose was Main Street, past the strange and outdated drugstore which still served fountain drinks -- the one Chris and I went to some years ago -- the one Acy and I went to after visiting Joni when I was still in that rabid High School. I turned right, along Guadalupe Avenue, if that exists. I don't remember. I came upon a giant store called 'Sears Jeans' and all they had were jeans. Fucking kalhoty. It seemed out of place in the general desolation which was Fort Stockton, Texas. They had all kind of jeans -- for the fat -- for the thin -- for the ravaged -- everything. I walked curiously through the store, thinking that I really need some new pants (and, I do) and came upon a buffet. It was like a little paradise among capitalistic gloom. People were sprawled on their tables like drunkards, clutching jeans to themselves as if they were their children. On the tables were unfinished utopenec and tlacenka, like in a rancid czech pub. I went to the counter. The prices were in czech crowns. 40 Kc for a full meal -- including soup. "That's pretty cheap, vole" I told myself. Then I was walking home -- along Division Street, waiting for a screaming fit from my mother.
