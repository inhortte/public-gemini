As an experiment, I'm switching from the *Module* pattern of the **Entry** object to the *Prototype* pattern (and likewise to the *prototype* git branch). This humble post is a **test**. Soon, we shall see if it has worked.

And, by fumbling around with the methods (ie, sending the object **this** to each fucking one), I have made it work. Cute, eh?
