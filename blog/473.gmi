I am very hazy today. Of course, the reason for that is lack of sleep, a predominate norm in my life these days. It seems every night is punctuated with intermittent periods of slumber between longer and longer bouts with wakefulness. Shouldn't I be used to this sort of thing by now?

Anyhow, the office is ruefully quiet. Some fan-like-apparatus buzzes in the background. I let it be as my companion since my ears are a bit numb from the hours with my headphones. Am I the only one who feels increasingly lethargic after listening to music (no matter how much I like it or not) on headphones for hours? I should break my working day up with walks around KarlÃ­n (a little like my nightly wakefulness is broken up by short naps) -- that would be pleasant.

Two lj friends have commented so far about spring. After the longish, evil winter, it came as a surprise to myself that I enjoyed the weather as it grew increasingly warmer. Still lots of random fluctuations in wind velocity and percipitation, however. Ach jo. To je jedno.

Wow. I wonder if I shall begin consistently writing here again?
