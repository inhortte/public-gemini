Whilst peparing and during *lunch* today, the television was on in the kitchen / dining area. One can imagine that I was not in my own household, not owning a television. The news was blathering away at a tolerable volume. The story was of **death**. Apparently, during a *futbol* match in Madrid, fans of the two competing teams formed teams of their own and proceeded to beat each other senseless. The results were many injuries and one **death**.

#### Death?

Why??? Mind you, this is over a *futbol* match. I know people are passionate about sports, just like I am passionate about music. Many of my friends are passionate about sports (well, and music, too). We don't go beat others who disagree with our specific preferences senseless, however.

#### Death?

The *corpse* was carted away in some sort of vehicle whilst the injured were taken to a hospital in ambulences. *This all occured at the same time the match was continuing as if nothing had happened at all.* Once again, I am deeply disappointed in my species. Humans prefer diversion, escapism and entertainment over the reality that seethes around them. They grease themeselves up in the lubricant of unmindfulness so anything that might wake them up just flows on by.

#### Fuck um.
