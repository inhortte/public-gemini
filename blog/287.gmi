I cooked Tortilla con Patatas this noon between talks to my, i suppose, ex-love. She told me she'd call in 1 1/2 or 2 hours and I took a walk, came back, was hungry, was lonely, was despondent. So I created the tortilla. I made a fucking mess in Suzie and Loyal's kitchen. The tortillia was mediocre. Like me. Today was the last day I will talk to Jana. She leaves to England in less than 6 hours. Our discussion today was among the most sexual and most relentlessly depairing. Details would be painful. Would you like to have some Tortilla con Patatas? There are some still left. Hm.
