Listening to King Crimson... their new stuff. Mp3. Great. I suppose I love it. I should be happy with it, as it says. But I suppose I should speak about my weekend, which was as unfortunately placid as I might have predicted had I been utterly drunk during the whole of it. The highlight was Saturday night when we had demasiado comida at Eli's place. She fed us as if we were pigs reined for years in a slop house which enforced fasting. Tortilla con patatas y salad con granada. Also, we brought some self-concoted sushi and she seemed to be happy with it as she should have had to been happy considering the occasion. An aside -- she has agreed to cut my filthy and wry hair before I leave this rainy yet tepid place.

That brings me to another point.
