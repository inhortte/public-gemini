Attempting to frown again, he reads over what he last wrote.

"NataÅ¡a is righting the slobbering creature in the corner of the studio. It grunts and licks at her. She breathes a futile harumph. The thing's due to be on the air in thirty minutes and is clearly not ready. Half dressed and clearly stoned on some inebriating substance, one eye ogles her neckline while the other rolls eerily. She pulls at the ring on her left hand. She always does when her immediate desires do not come to fruition.

"She slaps at the drool easing from holes in the thing's face and it splatters patterns like play-fighting ferrets on the bluish studio wall. She watches them run down into more ominous shapes and then leaves to cancel each payment made during this and the previous morning.

"She is wet between her legs, but not because of the obvious allure of the beast's virility. She reviews a dream from the night before. It was filed away until the moment she noticed the wetness. I must do much and travel far before I enter the pool, she thinks. The creature sees her die. He is alone in the room."

He doesn't remember writing any of it.
