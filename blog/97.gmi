# Bring out your dead mellotrons

The backing of the part will be purely mellotron playing the chords two notes at a time, but not constantly! No no no! That would not be appropriate.

### The spice of this part will be **space**

And since I have been listening to quite a bit of **Space Music** the last few days, I'll make sure there are plenty of sweeps and gurgles accompanying the composed music. *Layered on top*, yes sir ee.

The chord progression, as I wrote, will be the same as in *Part III*, but it will be only run through **once** and at half the tempo. So, the lengths of the two parts will match exactly. Isn't this an amusingly sterile way to create a piece of music? I think yeah, but it amuses me greatly, so I shall continue. So, on to the Mellotron part. I shall return shortly.
