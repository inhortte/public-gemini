# Lucid days
## Topics: psychology
## 2008-11-17

Well, lucidity is running strong through all of my days. I concentrate on such things as Abstract Algebra and comprehend quickly as opposed to times when I fooled myself into believing I could learn and remember pretty much anything whilst my mind was muddied. That was very often throughout the last years, I am afraid.

Here is something I'd love to do: Go through "Beelzebub's Tales to his Grandson" slowly and write comments about the text and pursue thoughts which it ignites in my mind. This is an aim I shall begin tomorrow. That's Tuesday, baby! 18 November 2008: Another day of lucidity.
