Acy, you told me four years ago that you liked this song. Finally, I got the CD again (the original was stolen by someone who is a friend of us all). http://polaris.fucksheep.org/peter_blegvad/Downtime/14_-_Say_No_Now.mp3[1] Pa pa pa...

Acy:

> I don't really remember the song too well, except for a hint of recognition at the chorus :) But it really brought back that time in my life, and that visit, that meant a lot to me. I remember listening a lot to "Mayfly and the Rose" sometime in that period as well. I believe that was your Robert Calvert CD, do you have it on MP3?
