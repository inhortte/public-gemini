# New topic problem
## Topics: clojure, bugs, blog
## 2012-05-19

It seems when a new topic is required, an exception is thrown. The exception looks like this:

> java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassCastException: java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.util.Map$Entry
This makes no sense to me at the moment, so I'm doing a few tests. This post is the beginning of them. I hope you enjoy thoroughly.
