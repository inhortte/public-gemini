The melody came out like this:<br /> a (down to) e f d<br /> (up to) b (down to) e f d<br /> (down to) b (up to) d f# g#<br /> I was pleased when I first invented it, but feel like it could grow a bit stale over time without suitable variation. I'll let it spin round my head a bit longer. The melody will undoubtedly be used later as the basis for one of the 'songs' (ie, vocal portions of the piece) with many subtle changes showing up, but I suspect the root notes will remain the same. Therefore, that second b (the low one) may be inappropriate.

Shit, I really want to record something this weekend.
