# Lumps and stumps
## Topics: isolation, interaction, granularity
## 2012-10-06

Yesterday, my thoughts did not have enough granularity. That is, the granularity was too low. Their incipient relations were clipped at their collective buds. They grew singularly and apart from one another.

Lack of concentration and stumbling thinking which accompanies it results in this lumpiness. *Separate lumpiness*. The thoughts take on egos of their own, becoming much like humans in regarding themselves as unique and free-standing individuals. Given time, one of these thoughts would reign over all other triumphantly. The other thoughts, banished to peasantry, would diminish, possibly die off. A type of fundamentalism is victorious.

The flowing interaction between phenomena had been lost yesterday. Selfishness awakens and manifests itself in the aforementioned fundamentalism. The only way to re-increase the granularity and fluidity of ideas in the mind is introspection, or a better would might be *meditation*.

I realize I am a part of all thoughts and objects, that is to say, phenomena, around when the granularity is sufficiently high. Then, nothing matters but the flow from moment to moment.

*The perpetual goal*.
