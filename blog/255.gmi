After talking to my parents on Saturday night, I have decided, because of, for the most part (not withstanding my horrific guilt concerning the fact that i have not seen them in three years), my complete lack of funds at present, that I shall go to visit my parents for Xmas. Hopefully, I shall have the time and funds to see my wonderful friends who live within the same state (that means you, Tony). Speaking, parenthetically, of Tony, I hope that he reads this and realises that I have no guitar with me and that he should provide one (no matter the quality) so that we can at least create something dismal whilst I am in Austin. I want to play music, tone-tone. Can we? You would not believe the amount of paucity inhabits the silent tunnels of the past two years. I need some noise to gear up my pathetic life. Co delas? Â¿Que sabes? What do you think?
