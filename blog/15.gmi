When I was in Praha two weeks ago, I told Michal all about LucÃƒÂ­a. Well, probably not ALL about, but a good deal, anyway. We were rather blasted at the time, for sure. Since then (and prior, to an extent) the feeling has washed over me that it is finally time. Of course, I have written drivel similar to that sentence a multitude of times in the past, so it may not be immediately believed. Still, the feeling floods. The floorboards of my mind are sodden. The rafters will soon be entombed in the deluge.

I have never been one to be held at bay.

I mentioned in an email to LucÃƒÂ­a yesterday (or was it the day before?) something concerning rent in Buenos Aires. She did not reply. Only during our short discussion today via Skype was the subject breached. One of her initial questions was 'Are you serious this time?' I suppose it was warrented. The last year has been rather jangly concerning the rusted, decrepit chains which hold me in Brno. I suppose the Rubicon has been crossed -- at least mentally. No going back now.

Michal also expressed the desire to traverse the atlantic in early summer. A joint journey could be fruitful (not to mention pretty fucking big fun) but he'd be returning alone.

Sweet Entropy, are you listening? Is it time yet?
