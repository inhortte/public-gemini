Para-phrase:

> ... when the city had stretched its metal web from pole to pole, leaving green things only in the wells of immortal minds.
*The Fall of Earth City* by **Hawkwind** from *The Church of Hawkwind*, an album that I'll listen to at this very moment.

The conservatives rule in *Texas* even among the proclaimed Democrats (liberals? eh...). I have just been involved in a mass killing of organic creatures for no other reason than to maintain both useless aesthetics and anthropomorphic superiority/isolation. All possibilities of pests entering a certain perimeter has been rendered nil. Any infestation of green, herbivoric material, by means of slaughter, is no longer a concern.

This abstracts out to putting convenience above biodiversity. The monobiopsychosis of the state of Texas (or the *State of Texanship*) sees all life beneath it if that life intrudes on the whimsical habits of modern life.
