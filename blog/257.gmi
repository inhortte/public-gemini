In two days, i depart.

Night train to Madrid.

Flight to NYC.

Then to Dallas, then Midland.

It will be odd to be in the desert again.

Speaking of deserts, this last weekend, i bussed to Barcelona. Wonderful El Paso-like landscapes on the way (in specific, through AragÃ³n). Maybe I shall enjoy being in the desert again.

I do not like Heineken at all.
