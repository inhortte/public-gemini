Jayson, Tony and I (and perhaps others who are unnamed) drive in Austin near MoPac. I think We are going to see some concert or another, or perhaps driving for the simple hell of it. I am not driving. Tony is. Tony has never been the best driver. Jayson says this is a fucking hit. I deny it. I say no. He snarls at me for liking something which could possibly be popular. I am uncomfortable, but I have not found the part of me yet which lets me be comfortable for loving what I wish to love no matter the thoughts of others. No more details.
