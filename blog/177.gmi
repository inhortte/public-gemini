Sam and I were sitting in Pizza Hut (in Fort Stockton, Texas, of course -- our mecca). I had taken David's jambox and set it on the window sill. *Spectres* was in the tape deck. This song was playing. He listened intently. Sam was definitely good at that. His comment was that it did not create the mood it was attempting to create well enough. I'll listen to it again now and give my opinion.

Initally, the guitar does, for sure. Loneliness. Solitude.

Lee also loved this song very much. There was a compilation tape (a **mix** tape, as peasants call it) on which he included it. There were various other more popular songs from bands we listened to. For example: *Tom Sawyer* and *Dust in the Wind*. This was one which he dubbed *fantastic*. It wasn't a popular one, however, meaning it got no airplay at the time, of course. Well, it probably did somewhere, but not in West Texas. He was, at the time, rather immune to popularity or obscurity. He just chose what made him wince with emotion. It was one of his positive traits. Yup.

I think the song does create the intended mood. For me. I'm a relative bastard, though.

The next one is the best on the album and I shall listen to it in journalistic silence.
