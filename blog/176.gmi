The telephone in my room in Fort Stockton was, like Facebook or Twitter or LiveJournal or whatever, my connection, however vague and arrogant, to the outside world.

I'd call people and force them to listen to *Blue Öyster Cult* songs over the line. The quality was amazing, as you might imagine. The one victim which was the most pitiful was Sharon Weber. I made her listen to this very song attemping to convince her that BÖC were contemporary enough to be poppy. Well, yeah, this song is a bit poppy. I'm not sure about the quality these days, however. Nostalgia reigns.

In Journalism class at Fort Stockton High School, I was listening to the new *Yes* album at the time (*Big Generator*) and she was impressed (maybe that is an absurdly hyberboliscious word) that I was listening to something which was actually played on the radio. Hm! I wonder if she is still single. I'll probably never know.
