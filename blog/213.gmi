It's 16.15 now and lethargy suffuses me. I feel hot, sticky and ill. I'm sitting on Lisa's couch. I'm alone again in her place after seven months of absence. Yeah it is not the same physical place, but inhabits a similar spirit.

Why am I devoid of energy? The freshness of the morning has waned in waves over the last few hours. Now there is naught.

Sakra.
