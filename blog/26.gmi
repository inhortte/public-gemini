Can it be? Shall it be? Will it be? Is it inevitable?

What is Pohanka, anyway? Destruction is all I have ever sought. It creeps in my stillness and energizes my manic times. I slithered to Karolina's place, laced with vodka, the other night, and fonud myself unknowning of myself or of anything natural (though this is, in some ways, a transcendental state).

God damn it!

So I am banned from there for eternity. (Eternity is a very small amount of seconds for poor Karolina.) I tried to watch 'Idiocracy', but despite James's and Christian's lucid and adamant claims that the film is excellent, contemporary and telling, I found it pointless and tiring. Cynically, Perhaps I am growing into a toadstool of cynicism.
