# The comfortable path to oblivion
## Topics: change
## 2007-03-02

Last night I watched 'Match Point', a film I knew absolutely nothing about before popping it into the DVD drive. I soon found it that Woody Allen directed it. Well, I thought, at least there is that. He usually injects a bit of depth into his films. The story turned out to be quite unexpected. I was happily surprised.

The protagonist, in the end, chooses a life which is more comfortable over a life which is unstable but arguably makes him much more happy/satisfied. The film does not take any sides on this issue. It does not judge his actions. It is just a statement of what is. And I believe what Allen is trying to portray is that most people, being put in the shoes of the protagonist, would choose the same.

Another point the film makes is that it is damn near impossible to pry yourself out of a complex life -- just walk away from it -- without your whole world turning on its head, even though doing so would make you more happy in the end. It's the transitional phase that would suck. Badly.

I never want to choose what is comfortable over what would ultimately be more satisfying. Another reason for the upcoming change.
