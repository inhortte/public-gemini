After sitting in front of a terminal for most of the day, my brain is in a deflated state. Difficulty concentrating. Plague. Coffee or cigarettes may be the solution.

Last night, I created a spectacular pureed vegetable soup (potatoes, parsnips, carrots, leek, etc) which still awaits me this evening. Well, if the woman has not consumed it all.

The night before was Panang Curry with eggplant, red bell pepper and carrots over rice. Also damn tasty.

If tonight the soup is not enough, I shall whip up some gnocchi in a cream sauce. I could be happy just preparing food for the most of my future lifetime.

As long as I had good music to listen to in the process.

Blurmp.
