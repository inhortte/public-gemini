The *prototype* version of **blog_to_mongo** is not grabbing topics, arranging them, finding their ids, and scrunching them into the *topic_ids* array of the *entry* in **MongoDB**. We'll see if it is now and revisit this post shortly.

Excellent! I'll consider this **bug** closed. Speaking of which, I need real bug tracking for these projects. I'll defer to github[1], I **guess**.
