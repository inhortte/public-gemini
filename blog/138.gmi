**Now** a certain error is being an irritant. It looks like this:

**java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Key must be integer**

Here is the code spouting the error:

```
(defpage "/expand/:id" {:keys [id]}
  (let [e (entry/get-record id)]
   (normal-entry e)
   (expand-contract-link "contract" e)))
```

As any observant mustelid can see, there is nothing wrong with that code according to the Noir documentation[1]. I shall pull out pieces of my pancreas for a few more minutes flummoxing myself about it.

I dislike it greatly when a problem solves itself, and especially if it is just from tinkering a bit.

Here is the code:

```
(defpartial expand-contract-link [which e]
  [:br.clear]
  (link-to {:id (str which (:id e))}
           "#" which)
  [:hr.clear])

(defpartial ajax-hovno []
  [:script "ajax_hovno();"])

(defpartial normal-entry [e]
  (:entry e)
  (expand-contract-link "contract" e)
  (ajax-hovno))

(defpartial truncated-entry [e]
  (trunc (:entry e))
  (expand-contract-link "expand" e)
  (ajax-hovno))

; Ajax paths                                                                    
(defpage "/expand/:id" {:keys [id]}
  (normal-entry (entry/get-record id)))

(defpage "/contract/:id" {:keys [id]}
  (truncated-entry (entry/get-record id)))
```
