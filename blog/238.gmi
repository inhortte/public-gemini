Damn formatting. Ah well. Tomorrow morning I should finish finally the govno which must be done to achieve a state of employment again. I should be worried silly about money, but I am not in the least. The problem floats by like flotsam as I walk barefoot on the beach, enjoying the sensation of each step on the sand.

Speaking of stepping, I have been trying to apply ideas (twisted in my own manner, of course) from Boris' book on Buddhism (specifically on meditation) to my everyday life. Meditation whilst in movement, synchronizing breath with step. I concentrate on the present sensation of ambulation, of my body being carried forward by each step. I must admit that it is a fascinating feeling, especially if prolonged.
