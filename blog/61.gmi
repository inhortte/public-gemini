Hah! The bleariness has not yet overtaken me! My success at warding it off is the result of it not being there in the first place. THAT, my persistent reader, is the epitome of effort. Yes!

So, what shall I do today?

```html
<ul>
<li>Scheme for 1 1/2 hours.</li>
<li>Ecology for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Radiant & Lakife for 2 hours.</li>
</ul>
```

Let's see how it goes, even if my parents try to drag me into the quagmire of their negativity. Their plans and my plans have very few intersections.

That is just the way it is (baby).
