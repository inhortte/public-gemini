# Don't make a fool of Sylvestr

Someone sent me an email, so I have decided to begin writing in this damn fool thing again, absurd though it might seem. If anyone is interested, I am in San SebastiÃ n, Spain, but not for long. Those damned jaws of chaos keep dragging me from place to place and I am too weary to stop them. Without a single EURO, I will wander the freeways of Europe in hope that I shall eventually arrive again in Prague.

I do not have the strength right now to be caustic.

Just to sleep and sleep until I awaken to a sunrise away from this dreary place.
