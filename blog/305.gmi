The good news is that Dana and I are communicating again like good *creatures* should. The bad news is that I have Vesna here, also communicating well, happy and semi-satisfied. She said a few very poignant things last night with which I agree wholeheartedly. She said I should love her not because she is *good for me*, but because she is great. What she means is that I should love her for who she is, not what she does.

Dana said the exact same thing.

The way she is, not her doings, aspirations, etc, should be the reason I love her. I feel the same. Vesna loved Alex  because he was good for her, not for who he was as a human. This she feels regretful for and, ultimately, it is why she left him.

One more cigarette (Tony's ubiquitous *lucky* one) and my days as a smoker shall come to a close.
