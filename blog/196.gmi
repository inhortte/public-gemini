I was just thinking about lack of sleep and that sometimes you must make up for your downtime with uptime which dissolves, like salt does to water, whatever downtime you have made. Though the saline permeates, it can be driven away by other measures, such as piloting to the sea.

Though I don't know if that is for me. I wonder how far the sea is right now. The UK. Hello, home.

My parents say that I only care about myself. But, actually, they care about me caring about them, which is caring about themselves. It is selfish beyond anything I have ever experienced. They are enslaving their young. They are the infants now craving young to care for them. It is a recipricol cycle.

It's gone.
