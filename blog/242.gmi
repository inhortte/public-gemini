Two nights ago, we attended an 'avante-garde' ballet. I was, frankly, impressed. The music during the first set was fully percussive and incorporated quite nice timbral textures locked in polyrhythmic grooves. Too bad I did not catch the composer's name. Bastard me. The second was a revelling rolick of semi-dark, upbeat symphonic stuff with hoards of balleters scrambling in a frenzy around the stage while a single, white-clad one practised stretches, oblivious, behind the bars of a cage. Near the end, the music turned more dissonant and the revelers left. The lone dancer came to the forefront and careened and pirhouetted for the best performance of the night. Quite entertaining.

I reserved tickets for the Anekdoten/Present/Magma performance in July. Wee hee!
