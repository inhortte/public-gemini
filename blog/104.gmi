Conversation with a woman outside:

> She drives up in a car. I am smoking a
> cigarette.<br />
> "Did you need something?"<br />
> "Like what, for example?"<br />
> "You were staring at me."<br />
> "No, I am smoking a cigarette."<br />
> "Well, did you need something?"<br />
> "Who are you? Do you work here?"<br />
> "No."
