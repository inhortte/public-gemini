Something has infested me and refused to go away. In other words, I am fantastically ill. Summary --> Hovno.

Job:<br /> It is petering out. The capriciousness of Jan Kovarik is denting not only mine but many others' delight in remaining more than 30 seconds within a few metres of him. After the recent money scandal, I am going to stretch my illness to as long as possible, then, in the end, not return at all. Summary --> Fucker.

Music:<br /> I've completed about 70% of the portion of Draperies I mentioned in the entry last week. It is splendid! Yesterday, additionally, I put together the score for the <b>meat</b> of Sonata for a Sombrous Spirit (what a fucking awful title! What was I thinking?) to send Tony. With a bit of expansion and practise, it could also become reality.
