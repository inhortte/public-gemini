Our talk of subserviance yesterday (or was it the day before?) reminded me of an ego that permeates Western Culture. I step up and he steps down. I squash his face with my boot. I smile. He wears a frown.

Why are those who are subserviant seen as a lower class? Sometimes they are pitied. At other times, they are mocked. What if the slave takes joy in serving the so-called master? What exactly is the problem in that?

This feature of our culture reminds me of fundamentalism. I see you as subserviant, so I try to convince you that you must pull yourself up by whatever means (usually psychologically) so you can reign instead of the oppressor.

Be it your wife or girlfriend or boss or parent.

What right do I have to tell you what you have to do to make a better life for yourself? Ok. Let's police the world in order to make it a better place. Let's police people psychologically to redeem them from whatever may, in fact, make them happy.

Er, right.
