Whoopie! Today I finalized my residence and work permit in the nefarious, humid, crowded Kreisverwaltungsreferat. Say that 26 times quickly. Fucksheep seems to be down. No idea why. The weekend was filled with pattern matching code which flowed from my fingers and into Emacs flawlessly (well, actually with a few flaws, but they can be overlooked). But, unfortunately, I did not even as much as touch my guitar. Can I will myself to remedy this today?

As in the past, the onslaught of encroaching summer hate (heat) dulls my will and ambition. But I shall stay stranded in this concrete hades until in my pocket once again are those colourful notes which promote escape.
