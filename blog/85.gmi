Thinking about *Salience*, I've been concentrating on lack of specific focus when it comes to aural stimuli. Therefore the focus drifts from sound to sound in a spacious sphere enclosing me. In the car on the return trip from the grocery just a bit earlier, instead of blocking out the faint flapping of air scooting through the driver's side cracked window, or the crumbling crush of my father's cigarette being extinguished, I let the minute sounds usher themselves into my left aural field. I identified their position and distance without discursive thought. They lay over the hum and tremolo of the vehicle's journey along the asphalt. The words my father spoke were not meaningful in a linguistic manner, but created an ostinato of vaguely *a b a a g*.
