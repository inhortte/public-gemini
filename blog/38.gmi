Jayson and I sit listening to this song. He comments on the guitar part, the vibrato and its repititions and how it creates a mood of otherworldliness. It is 1991. We shared many scintillating hours with this album. We go to Chili's and discuss how Tony and Chris have become close, moved in together and how he and I were doing the same.

He says it may be as life should be that we become close as we are the most lyrical of the gang. He always sang along with everything. (I lapse into past tense again.) He was for sure more lyrical than I, in general. Texture was more my worry, though I did not know it back then. If I had, we may have done what Tony claimed - taken over the world (if we could indeed have played our instruments). Texture. It is my current goal.
