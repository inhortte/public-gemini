I postulate that **IT** humans who are more interested in hardware and low-level programming (such as machine and assembly code and possibly C) are more likely to be interested in repetitive, logical tasks. They are also the ones who listen to *Techno* whilst working (and whilst doing other repetitive activities).

Others, who enjoy the elegance of high level languages are more creative, more holistic, and overall better people.

Heh.
