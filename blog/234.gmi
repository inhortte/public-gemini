Heat. A breeze would be nice, but this stifling computer lab, windows though it has open, offers not even a hint of one. Bells play about my aural sphere, emanating from somewhere other than this room (although sweltering they may be, as well). Ah, the mediaeval postures of a modern city.

I began a book on buddhism. I am taken back to my days in Clear Lake, alone in my commodious dwelling, poised in meditation, and oddly satisfied. Prolly just nostalgia. Boris gave the tome to Vesna. She might well benefit from its pages better than I would.

I hope to finish 'Stone Calendar' tomorrow. It has gone from being a calming, ambient piece punctuated with meditative, pulsating passages to becoming a confusing wash of chaos and evil. And this is a good thing.
