I am walking from a small town in north-western Spain with this song playing in my ears. Ah, the whole album, not just this song. The most telling and touching one comes next. The sign says 100 metres to the turnoff to the campsite and the beach. I count steps along with the 4/4 of it. I am glorified in my solitude. I am not looking forward to reaching the tent, intend to purchase a flask of beer before arriving though I know she'll be angry, questioning the reason though she knows it gives me temporary escape - pleasure even. The songs still echo through my brain as I explain to her one of my goals - my dreams - to own a cafe which plays music winding up an atmosphere of deep sentimentality. Is it for me, or is it for the patrons? For the former, I am sure. Though the dream is perhaps the best - a way to love what I own and project it onto others, let them share what in my rotten soul may be names as Love.
