As Christián once again attends to his seven to eleven times daily fecal ritual, I begin my first entry whilst in the magnificent city of Praha. I am at U Zavěšenýho Kafe[1].

As Christián returns from one of his seven to eleven times daily fecal ritual, I continue my first entry whilst in the magnificent city of Praha. I've been here before - in this café, that is. However, it was very long ago and I do not recall the details or even with whom I was. I suspect that it was Renata. It may also have been Hela, but I doubt it. We'll go with Renata, since she lived near Hradčanská and insisted on always hanging out in her own *barrio*.

Had I convinced the very lazy and recently gluteally violated Christián to ascend further onto *Uvoz* and then to Pohořelec[2], I would have encountered many more half-nostalgic cafés attended by Renata and myself in the distant past. I could even find the one where she berated me for drinking too much. I'd like that. I miss that woman.

It is very possible that we shall still ascend after our time at this mysterious but familiar café.

Soon, however, I will be forced to take the teaspoon on the silver platter pictured beside my *svařeně vino* and pry one of the eyeballs from Christián's eyesocket. The reason for this is that he keeps talking about *grids*. When I was a child, I was forced to live in a *grid* with other children, and therefore to interact with them relentlessly. Obviously, this alarmed and angered my profound sense of introversion and sociopathy. The *grid* made these fundamental parts of my personality swell and consume most every other facet of the entity that was I. The swelling, much like a cyst on the scrotum of an infant, has never ceased, even to this day. I reach for the teaspoon.
