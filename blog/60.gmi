# Part one is done

I just watched part one of "Until the End of the World". It is cheesy, backwards looking, thin but very enjoyable. Something about Wim Wender's work appeals to me. The three negatives leading my description were purposeful, I am sure. True, however - the sheer length of the film is daunting. The weariness clasped to me still makes my mind stagger. This clattering wreck of a paragraph shows it well.
