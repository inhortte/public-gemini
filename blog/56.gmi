The film was fantastic. It is one I'll see many times in my life, finding arousing details each subsequent watch. I'm not sure how far we have progressed on our flight. Static in a chair, I feel as if I never left Praha at all.

I am not sure how I'll feel when I reach ground zero. I want to be in transit forever. Perhaps I am the happiest when I am on the move, when the ending is uncertain, or when the ending is so far away that I'll never see it in my lifetime.

I am talking about a personal ending, of course, and not a universal one.
