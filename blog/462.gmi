A friend of mine and I were, over beers the other night, coming up with names for songs (because naturally, it is more fun to start with a title than tack it on at the end of the compositional process). Here they are:

* She's in Zagreb - I'm here
* You Might Want to Get Out of the Building
* Gingerbread Rape Scene
* Your Slovak Bitch's Brains are on my Boot
* Where do you Draw the Line Between Consonance and Dissonance?
* I'd Prefer Seeing the Grand Piano Burn to the Ground
* A Fugue of Screaming Babies Being Slaughtered by Handsaws
* Anything that Rots is Good Fertilizer

They were a bit more amusing when we were drunk.
