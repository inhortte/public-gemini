I found a very annoying bug in the input 'script' for martenblog last night. I was too tired, however, to fuck with it. The fault of the mistake is mine. My lack of Node understanding caused it. The Entry module has a line like so:

```
module.exports = Entry;
```

It recently was like this:

```
module.exports = new Entry();
```

My suspicion is that the new Entry object is created **ONCE** at program initialization. So, when multiple files like this one are published, the _id of the first is preserved. Therefore, each subsequent file overwrites the original. Entiendes?

This is a seemingly useless addition to this post.
