I dare not spill the Sweet Leaf tea onto the blankets where I shall later sleep. I create enough wet spots as it is with my voluminous drooling.

Tonight is the night that I shall attempt to record all of **my** parts of the piece I have mentioned several times in this blog: *Reduction*. Instead of the synthesized bassoon, an acoustic guitar shall play the eternal melody first sketched in *Intersection*, which begins the still unnamed album*****.

The melody is this:

> *c d bes c g a bes g f*
It is playing in a *four* *three* 7/4 manner with varying notes taking a whole 7/4 bar.

As long as I have the music in front of me, I have no problem creating it with my new acoustic guitar (appropriately named *Aonyx Cinerea*). Following that is the strumming of the original chords Tony gave me over two years prior which helped spawn this project (album).

The chords are:

> *Csus9 Cmaj7 Fmaj Fmaj7*
> *Csus9 Gm Am Am7*
> *Dm Dm7 Besmaj7 C*
Wish me luck, oh happy-go-lucky angel, you.
