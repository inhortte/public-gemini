I mention to other humans from time to time that I dislike capitalism. I hold it in high disdain, actually, for its abhorrent nature. Asshole capitalists. Let them rot in a molten, golden soup. Some humans often shoot back at me something along the lines of *well, you are selling your wares for money, too, so you are a capitalist*. Either they are sealed in their own fundamentalist bubble so they cannot see the context of my existence or they outright refuse to believe that anything other than their own point of view exists.

Of course I *sell my wares for money*. I have to survive in the society that contains us. Ideals exist that I may pine for, but I do not simply abandon everything to pursue them. As much as capitalist scum want a free for all, our occidental world is one of compromise, not of extremes. I *sell my wares for money* but I don't jump at the chance to monetize every grain that grows from the bosom of my brain or hara. We are all somewhere on an axis, not at an *chuck everything and live an ideal* or *submit to the capitalist free for all* extreme.

Axis thinking. Brian Eno wrote about it in his novel. I've talked about it for decades. I'm sure we are not the only ones. Consider it.
