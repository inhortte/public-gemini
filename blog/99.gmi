I must name the album. I must do it now. So what shall the album's name be? Hm. Well, what is the theme, exactly? We have which titles so far?

* Intersection
* Filter
* Cycle
* She Ain't My Girl
* Union
* Untitled
* Fold
* Untitled

The obvious conclusion is to title the album something regarding sets. So, what does *set theory* come up with when typed into the mighty **Google**, **Wikipedia** and **Thinkexist**. The results are, respectively:

Hm. Well, actually, that did not work very well, so let's attempt putting all of the song titles (including the untitled ones, just for amusement's sake) simultaneously into google and see what happens.

Again, nothing.

My cupped palms have come up empty.
