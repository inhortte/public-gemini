# Another black/white
## Topics: black/white, knowledge
## 2012-10-20

Let's make another dichotomy. *There* are ones who spend their lives delving deep into a subject. Then *there* are ones who stay the drug of knowledge and instead go broadly into many subjects. The former are the celebrated. The latter are the ones who can communicate with all, but are easily forgotten.

Then there are those who attempt to do both at once. They die in a mire of quicksand which envelops like a predator.
