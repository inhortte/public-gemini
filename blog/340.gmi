# Ambient noise is a fog in my brain

Considering that I have no idea what will happen at the aeroport on Sunday, I am not very nervous about my impending voyage (doom) to Praha from Madrid. Originally, I thought I'd leave Fresneda tomorrow via bus from Belorado and arrive in LogroÃ±o at an unspecified time in the evening. I would then have an evening in the *casa* in Paseo del Prior alone to collect my rational and recharge my hungry power supply.

At the moment, I am sitting on the bed in Marisa's room in Fresneda (as opposed to the bed in *my* old *room* in the other house that I had grown a bit acusomed to) trying to ignore the people shouting fragments of conversation at each other to and from the upper floor (where I write). We shall embark on a *paseo* to get away from the closed spaces and multitudinous warm bodies.

At least, that is the relief it will give me.

As the room is being populated by others who must conduct conversations no matter if a proper topic exists or not, I am a bit distracted and shall continue like a proper mustelid later.
