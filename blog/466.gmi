# Autumn Dies

## 2005-12-21

I find myself in Seminole, Texas. All is peaceful. All is calm. All is tentively boring. However, I do my best to entertain myself. Amusement is, after all, the greatest reason for being alive.

My plans to visit Austin are thwarted. My parents do not wish to drive me even a meager half-way to the capital city of the state of my upbringing. I am stuck.

So I read. I listen to music. I scribble in my journal. I win $750 at the casino in Ruidoso (where I was with my parents from Sunday until yesterday). I get a haircut. I avoid the television with its contagion.

I fail to find the lyrics to Amarok's Tierra de Especias on the internet.

**Music:** Elend - Wind Devouring Men
