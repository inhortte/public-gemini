It's 1991 and I am in my room in College Station. It is only a few minutes walk to Chris and Jayson's place. I am staring blankly at the white walls adorned with a few posters (one of Kate Bush). This song plays and I am melancholy, as the music demands. Kindle floats through my mind and ideas of a liaison with her taunts. It is an unrequieted future. I should have known from the outset.
