I am split between the idea of saving a race or group of a species (including humans) who have been overtaken and passed by the remainder of the world and left far behind and letting them die out as most non-adaptive creatures have in the past.

Technology is the main culprit for this rushing onward. Being left behind means inevitable death.

Being a sort of conservation *biologist* (I should really put that word in quotes), I veer towards the former path. I clearly see that the latter road is the one that nature always takes with every race/group/species that is left behind.
