# Dust and nightmares in flatland

It is the first night in *Ruidoso*. I am with my parents but thankfully in my own room at the hotel. Perfecktni. I awoke at 8.30 at my father's summons and nigh an hour later we were on the road through the bleak flatness of West Texas and Eastern New Mexico to end up finally in the semi-mountainous serenity of *Ruidoso*.

Our first destination, of course, was *Billy the Kid* casino. I failed to win a single thing, and in this regard secure the beginnings of an accumulation towards Habosh's Iriver and rent (and hopefully a bit to sustain myself on, as well). My hopes were set high, as were my insipid expectations, by last year's winnings (squandered away during my first two months back in Praha). I was shattered.

After sitting around in the hotel room for a bit of, as my parents say, *putting your feet up time*, we proceeded to the *Travel Center Casino*. I fared somewhat better at the beginning there, playing a four wheel slot (the forth of which was a bonus spindle) of the **Flaming 7** variety. I put what little I won away into my stash. I accumulated a bit more, but nothing too substantial.

Back at *Billy the Kid*, there was to be a drawing for perhaps $4500. That would be a mighty satisfactory sum for my stash. Of course, I did not win, nor did my father or mother. We gambled and I won $75 playing **Wheel of Fortune**. I lumped it with the rest in my wallet. So far, it is not thick enough, for sure.

Now I'm in the hotel room trying to decide which channel on the television (*O! That dreaded object!*) would entertain me most. Or I could continue solving puzzles in my *Sudoku* book. **OR PERHAPS BOTH. YES. UM. YEAH.** Fucking bad, boring, stifled writing today. I must do better.
