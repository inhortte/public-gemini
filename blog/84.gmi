# A Sealed Womb

I enjoy bitching about the despotism that was always a part of my ex-friend Christian and began manifesting itself more and more in his personality throughout the years. It was repressed for quite a long time whilst he was with his bane and obsession, Karolina, and spewed forth geyser-like when he popped free of that relationship.

In Cloud Atlas, there is a discussion of a hermetic environment. I believe that is what Christian, in his despotism, is attempting to create. The people who inhabit his world are to be sealed away from outside influence at all costs. Any deviance is crushed mercilessly. He longs to be the sole mind and have his subjects be mere pieces to achieve useless (in my opinion) aims. Communication with the outside universe is limited to foraging or manipulating for funds.
