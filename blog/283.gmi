Suzie and Loyal chat about things I cannot discern in their bedroom and I am finally alone in my bedroom (their living room). The couch on which I sit shall serve as my sleeping place in a few weary hours. Somewhere in the flat, there is the soft padding of their cat and Slapp Happy grates away through the air reminding me painfully of Jana. Sometime during the next week my fate should, if all goes well, be sealed for some months. I shall empty by brain into the workplace which is also Loyal's own upon each workday and also, I am sure, during many weekends. This time it will be solamente for money and my mortal flesh shall be, because of cash's uplifting quality, bound around the world once again and hopefully land in beauteous Praha, home of my craving(s).

I am very happy with our jukebox. Well, our computer on whose hard drive are a sprawling 5 or so days worth of music usually set on random play.
