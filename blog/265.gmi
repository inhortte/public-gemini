It was perhaps the most depressing Xmas of my life. Ufff... Now, at least being somewhere which allows me to access internet makes it 'un poco suave' in a manner, loosens my fingers and unfreezes my mind. The bleakness here is almost unbearable, and were I not less drunk, I would describe it in a marbleizing manner. The conversation I had with the only human in this wilderness that I remotely care about cerca two days prior revealed the same sentiments as I have. A prolonged visit here would result in suicide. I want to go to Pecos, Texas, to be reminded. I want to see the grave and cry. The claws of time and of atrophy have torn me to pieces. Why did I ever return to the Good Ol' USA?
