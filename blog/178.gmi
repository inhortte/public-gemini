Again, at Fort Sockton High School. Javier Hernandez (why do I remember his name?) was talking to his friend (Probably Miguel) about this song. And it was within ear-reach of me. He just said that *Monsters* is a cool song. Or something similar. I had made him a tape of songs I enjoyed. I did curb things on the tape towards *metal*, so this was on it. But is this song metal?

What is metal?

I recall that *26000 Days* by the Moody Blues was on the tape, as well.

This album came a bit late into my consciousness. I believe it was my Junior Year, though I cannot be sure. Perhaps before. Nice song. Bouchard again? I believe so. Albert & Joe always wrote the more intriguing songs.
