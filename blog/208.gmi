On our drive back to Cihuri from LogroÃ±o, I brought up that I had listened to two albums by the Beatles the night before. The two albums were *Abbey Road* and *Revolver*, in that order. I'd wanted to listen to the *White Album*, but Soulseek does not seem to work from here. IE, I have no copy of it. Our tired conversation drifted from one genre of music to another. Madis talked about Estonian folk. He named bands. I acknowledged knowing some. I named bands. He didn't know many. I didn't mention Anna Maasik. I am not sure why.

Then he started talking about ballads. There's this guy who does an album of ballads. Something like that. He told me that Sidorovich drove around the fields of Belarus listening to it. The answer was *Roger Waters*. The album? Well, what else might apply? Which would entice a biologist (a disillusioned one, at that?)? **Amused to Death**.

It will take quite a bit to get this image from my mind. Possible, this is because I love it.

I just began listening to the album. It has been a while.
