Spanish pop music drools from the speakers overhead as I wait to leave this place, to leave and hobble on feet which feel like pegs towards home. Once I arrive, I plan to create, in a pan of popping oil, palacinky. Palacinky are very tasty, especially when prepared with the diligence of a true Eastern European cook such as myself. That is about enough on that topic.

Someone told me today that it will take some time before I get up to speed on understanding that poetry-stuff. I suppose my response to his poem provoked that -- and a purposefully silly response it was ... indeed. If all of the poetry I have written of late was water, almost every camel on God's Green Earth would dehydrate. That's a fact.

Na Shledanou.
