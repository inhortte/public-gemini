# Deafening drumbeats undulate my colon
## Topics: dreams, natascha

I don't think I've ever tried writing whilst attempting to defecate before so I am persuing this bit of multitasking at the moment.

I had a very peculiar dream during the early hours of the morning. There was a huge multi-concert festival like something at a two level club somewhere in continental Europe and I was attending. I don't recall who the headlining band(s) were, but some of the lesser acts were **AC/DC** and **Harry Potter**! Odd.

I was there with *Natascha*. Myriad other people I knew were there, as well, including old and new people in my life. Ira was there, smoking, with a group of frat-like buddies. They were in attendance for the cheese metal.

At one point, Jonatan and I were sitting either side of Natascha doing that weird humming/singing thing she and I used to perform as we walked the streets of NYC. Houmlesak was there, standing on a chair, cheering on a small local band. I head-banged with him for a moment.

The focus, was, however, Natascha. We leaned in and kissed for what seemed to be an eternity whilst everyone else watched. We held each other. She disappeared when I was examining Emma Watson's passport. I strode around the place looking for her, finally finding her downstairs in the swimming pool.

She called me her hero.
