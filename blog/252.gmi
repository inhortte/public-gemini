Off into another sunny day in Donostia, Pais Vasco, EspaÃ±a. An optimistic sweetness sickens my departure from this place. The bright, orthogonality of the room suddenly becomes dim and sulking, leaning on me as if to crush and digest.

I must explore the remaining green areas of the city before my departure and photograph them since my memories shall surely wane.

Half of me is a corpse and the other half wants to keep dragging the whole forward until some cure for partial ressurection is discovered. A pill? A potion? Yoga?

Mis dias son testarudos.
