# Sweltering afternoon in someone else's stolen homeland

So I have just spent an hour updating my livejournal "interests". A few surprising notes: I found another Magma fan, a Henry Cow fan, and a few other fractional siblings in thought. It is just simply amazing the kind of people you can find when you have a site available to the diversity offered on the internet. One thing I did notice, however, and which disappointed me, is that very few journals I perused were written by non-USA-type-people (only one, in fact).

Still no work on "Stone Calendar". I shall soon walk the fifteen minute walk to my place of residence and prepare humous (interspersed with the taking up of my gueetar and layin' some mean chords onto tape).

Yeah.
