# Familial Disease
## Topics: family, culture, aristocracy, bubbles
## 2020-05-23

Herr ChristiÃ¡n mentioned that he considers the *aristocracy* those that feel their ilk, meaning those closest to them, meaning their families, deserve to be in some means **above** others. In that the so-called **nobility** in the forlorn times was something akin (pun intended) a giant family, he is correct. Familiarity breeds a feeling of superiority, a group-think nobility. This idea extends from the family to the community and to the city and nation. It is another form of bubble, and concentric bubbles with varying degrees of permeability, unifying in one sense, but beds of xenophobia in another.

As Shambal says, **fuck um**.
