Tomorrow I go to fabulous Fort Worth to visit my family. Moje rodina. It has been a long time. I wonder how much more alienated I shall feel during and afterwards. After the discussion with Chris today about his hopelessness, the whole idea of staying here for a lengthy time frightens me exceedingly. Everything here irritates me. Even the voices. That accent! Eructing words into ill-built phrases. Je odporny.
