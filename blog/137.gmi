# Ruby has found a Clojure.
## Topics: clojure, martenblog, sheepblog
## 2011-10-09

I've begun porting **Sheepblog** (IE, this thing you are looking at right now) from *Ruby/Sinatra* to *Clojure/Noir*. I am in the beginning phases, but I believe that the database schema will stay the same for now.

#### New features

* When not creating or editing a post, topics will set the session key :topic to the topic's id. Any look at /rutabaga will show only posts which pertain to the set topic.
* Multiple user capability. Hopefully Christopher will eventually post something.
* Comments, by user or anonymous.

### First problem!

*clojure.contrib.sql* no longer exists. Or, rather, it exists in an outdated form which breaks everything in sight with an unsightly **getRoot not found** or somesuch error. Use *clojure.java.jdbc* instead.
