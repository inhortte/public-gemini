The moment of Viking showing himself to me. It was so real that I know my subconsciousness misses him. I wish I could recall the remainder of the dream. Besides the multitudes of people in the past, and how we were all at Tony's before we went to the... the celebration. But Tony didn't come. I was sitting and Scott Hazle was there (actually, he was there from the beginning), and reminding me of lucidity. Damn.
