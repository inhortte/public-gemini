# Iron Maiden and Castellano
## Topics: music, concerts, friendship
## 2005-05-29

After going to the crazily overpriced Iron Maiden gig in the very stuffy T-Mobile arena at Výstavyště full of more than 20 000 heat-generating humans (and one cat), Patricia, Habosh, Rostej, et. al., and I went to a pub to drink beer and smoke pot. During the course of the evening, Patricia began to give Habosh Spanish lessons. He got to learn very important and useful phrases such as "No puedo trabajar porque estoy colocado." Soon I suspect he'll be ready for a job interview in Spain.

This has certainly been a fecund month for concerts. Porcupine Tree (ok, at the end of last month), Jaga Jazzist, Waltari, Guapo, Iron Maiden and three festivals full of popular Czech bands that you probably don't know. Dobrý.
