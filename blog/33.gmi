# Almost with You
## Topics: el paso
## 2008-10-03

I am in El Paso. Perhaps this is playing in the background. Acy is on the phone. I am running up a bill that I'll never be able to pay. We speak and laugh. We always laughed at our absurdities. It healed me whilst I was alone. I lie on that small, uncomfortable bed. Papers are scattered on the floor around a keyboard on which I wrote the bass part for 'Tomorrow Never Came'. Tony played it pretty much to perfection. He is always diligent in that manner. It plays also in my truck, uncared for but functional, as I drive semi-randomly around west El Paso, perhaps in search of Maggie's mansion. I find it. I sit. I drive on - back to the house adjacent to Lacey's place to listen again and again to 'The Blurred Crusade'.
