# Let's define ourselves by the things we hate

The dichotomy of black and white as opposed to living without any kind of conflict because no conflict actually exists. *Western Culture* creates a sense of good and evil in everyone. Without something to fight against, there is nothing to define ourselves by.

Indigenous people who live in harmony with their own ecosystem accept all around them as it is - they are *harmonic*, if you will, to use a clichÃ©'d phrase. The mentality of black and white simply doesn't exist. There is no reason to define oneself because conflict against something else. Rather, humans live in a culture which is at one with its ecosystem.
