I believe many people I know would have a problem with this concept. Ego manifests itself and denies oneself the ability to be one's own opponent. Christián is a good example. I'd say, most likely, Acy, as well. Let's throw in James for good measure.

Ashley's post aligns perfectly with humility and the denial of pride and self-worship. One's ideas can be crucial to one's development mentally, but they are not the end all. Tempering and expanding them with outside concepts is tantamount! Jah.

Observations in my line of work over the years has seen egocentric behaviour often. There is an idea entitled *egoless programming* which promotes severing yourself from emotional ties with your creations and therefore letting others hack and rearrange their contents. In such an environment, programmers holding on to absurd pride in their creations are expunged, as they should be.

I recall when Christián asked me to look over his writing. The grammar and spelling were atrocious. I took to editing it. He was offended. How could someone dare to even touch much less manipulate his creation? Damn ego.
