I just whipped out *A Passion Play* by The Tull after finding that its flacs I uploaded to Gulo yestrday evening do not work (on Gulo). Vittata plays them nicely. I noted, as I surely have oodles of times, that the album begins with heartbeats echoing *The Dark Side of the Moon*. *Gonwards* begins in this manner, as well. If one thinks it over a bit, normally, an album about the journey through a life should begin thus.

Sitting here writing when I should be working, I am enjoying this band to which I used to listen in my adolescence. Pink Floyd was another and I did enjoy *Animals* thoroughly the other day. Conversely, I have absolutely no interest in revisiting *The Wall* or *The Dark Side of the Moon* once again. Was it overexposure? They don't tittilate my nipples like they did in my youth.

Yet, *A Passion Play* and *Animals* do. I'll resist making a pun, as I mostly consider puns a product of sloppy thinking.
