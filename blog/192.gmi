# Childhood values as the basis of the future
## Topics: childhood
## 2012-10-19

Discussion now centres around how the Uralic culture always wants their children to grow up around reindeer. *You cannot be a human without reindeer around you*. And the transfer of values to children because of this let them grow up in a ethically rich way and pass the same values on to their own culture.

If this were me, the world would be a desert. Desolation. Nothing. My childhood should not be passed on.
