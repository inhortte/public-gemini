Depression is annoying, especially depression which seems to have no basis. It's been creeping up on me all day (stealthily, I might say, though I could sense something growing) and has now reached a plateau. It's hard to think. It's hard to function. Why? What causes this? It consumes me about once weekly with varying intensities. Should I go on anti-depressants? I surely don't want to.
