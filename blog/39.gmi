Marcie is obsessed with this song. We are at her house, in her room (upon the carpet that I gleefully bought and installed) discussing it. She lounges on her bed as I sit before the stereo. Our relationship is knitting together unlike it ever did before.

The civilized gentleman is gonna be nice.

It is the peak. All is downhill from here. I skip my classes. I do everything to satisfy my obsession to be with her. Her parents approve. At first, this bewildered me, but then came as a natural thing. Adaptability has always been one of my strong traits.

Then there is the paper route. This album permeates the smallish space within my truck (even more confined from the presence of the multitudes of rolled papers piled wherever room can find them). There is also King Crimson 'The Great Deceiver' in these days. Endless hours of hated yet enjoyed rollings with friends.

Angelica - stop making up those lies!
