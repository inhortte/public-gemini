*He might burn out the divinity generator, and then, where would they be?* I have not really **got** the brilliance of this album until just now. Yeah, I know that Blegvad is a wordsmith and Partridge a (as well as a wordsmith) soundscapesmith.

The foothills of **Hell**.

I recall when I was listening to this in Zabehlice when Justin was around, visiting, or whatever he called it (yes, I am bitter). He listened for a moment (or perhaps I only regarded it as a moment - I don't know), and declared - "Some guy reciting poetry. Why do you like this? And bad poetry, at that."

How wrong he is. But, I mean, of course, in my opinion.
