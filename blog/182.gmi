# Can one fall in love with one who lacks imagination?

The subject question is a touch of the realism I experienced today after feeling a emotional push that I don't get very often these years. Kairi and I were in *Selver* in *Kuressaare*, purchasing a few things for our lunch. This event itself (lunch) did not occur for several hours.

This **push** came when I saw her randomly in the shop after we split upon entrance to find our separate comestibles. She smiled when we bumped into each other and my stomach dipped. I did and did not like the feeling, but definitely acknowledged it for what it was. Were I a mid 20s to mid 30s freakish laddie, as I used to be, I'd be at this moment head over heels. As my mental balance teeters now, I'm not sure it is a good idea.

She's made no comment on music that I play *which plays constantly when we are in the guest house*. She doesn't acknowledge any art standing about the island, or anything particularly man-made at all. Her appreciation of nature is acute, of course, as she is a biologist. The imagination doesn't seem to be included in the *package*.

Can you choose your friends? Can you choose your relationships?

I'm not sure if she is *taken* or not. That's never really been a problem for me before, however, as we all know.

We have three more days alone. In no way am I assuming anything will happen outside of conversation, but I expect we'll grow closer. I have always had a way of creating a type of shibboleth with practically anyone I am left alone with for some time.

The lunch consisted of sitting on bench in KÃ¤rla (in the laulja place... where choirs sing to hapless recipients of latent information), munching and chatting about hometowns and tiny aspirations. Yesterday's lunch was more *intellectually* involved. The great **Buddha** himself took part.

*Meil on selle nii aega* will surely remind me of this day.
