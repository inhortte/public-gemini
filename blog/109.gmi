# Nightmares of blueberry cobbler

I wonder how *cobbler* came to mean a sort of pastry filled with cooked berries or other fruits? A *cobbler* is someone who fixes footwear. The idea of the semantic drift is truly staggering.

* Repairing a shoe
* Filling the shoe with a foot after reparation
* Allowing the shoe to become a crumbly pastry
* Detaching the foot from the remainder of the body
* Allowing the meat of the foot to become vegetarian
* Making sure the vegetarian items within the ex-shoe is now a fruit
* Popping the whole thing into the oven
* Feeding the result to southern geezers in casinos or upscale hotel buffets

Yeah.
