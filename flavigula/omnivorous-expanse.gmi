# Omnivorous Expanse
## 2020-06-08



Sometimes, The Universe conspires to orchestrate unseen, certain events, meetings, etc. in a serendipitous way.

Such was the case for the tracks you hear on this album.

Two people who, as their relationship develops, realise that they perhaps have more in common than first appeared to be the case: musical tastes, influences and even some philosophical and metaphysical interests.

Somehow, despite different abilities and not having known each other for long, something "clicked" and, almost alchemically, tracks came together -- as if they had lives of their own.
