# Flavigula Releases

## Za Rušení

2020-12-07

Initially, this album was to be a collection of "noise" pieces for the infamous Noisevember. The idea was to take a series of between 3 and 5 notes generated randomly by a Bash script as each piece's basis. The concept lasted for less than half of the cycle, but the aleatory spirit lived on.

The music evolved as a unit into something more than a mere month-long writing binge and is collected here as a (hopefully!) coherent whole.

## Omnivorous Expanse

2020-06-08

Sometimes, The Universe conspires to orchestrate unseen, certain events, meetings, etc. in a serendipitous way.

Such was the case for the tracks you hear on this album.

Two people who, as their relationship develops, realise that they perhaps have more in common than first appeared to be the case: musical tastes, influences and even some philosophical and metaphysical interests.

Somehow, despite different abilities and not having known each other for long, something "clicked" and, almost alchemically, tracks came together -- as if they had lives of their own.

Tim Rowe - voice, synthesizer & drum programming
Bob Murry Shelton - guitar, tenor ukulele, modular synth, other synths and effects

Words by Tim except for "Universal Curtains" by William Blake and "Möbius Institute" by Edgar Allan Poe

## Älläï

2019-12-16

"Allai" is the idea of looking yonder, up, over there, or on the bright side. It is the vast, yawning abstraction that engulfs you from any one of those places.

It's also the name of a plastic penguin that our imaginary flute player had as a child. That penguin meant everything. Please consider this whilst you listen.

Bob Murry Shelton - guitar, myriad effects, a modular synth named "THE FURNACE", Supercollider, sneezings, brief mutterings
Christian Michael Newman - pink fuzz, voice, palmas, extensive mutterings and caffeination
James Anthony Hogard - bass
Matthew Riley Walsh, Attorney at Law - piano

Music composed by Bob
Lyrics to Fold by Christian
Lyrics to House of Strength and Love by Bob & Christian
Edited and arranged by Bob & Christian
Cover art by Christian

Thanks to Daniel García for inspiration.

## Za Rohem

2019-12-04

I was informed of the existence of "Noisevember" a day or two before the month began. The challenge was to create one noise piece per day. As one can see, my result was 21 pieces, not 30. I skipped many days and also did two or three other days.

I added more melody than I originally intended, but what spewed from my hara is what spewed from my hara.

Bob Murry Shelton - Guitar, Effects, Modular Synth, Supercollider.
Christian Michael Newman - Acoustic guitar on Čtrnáct, Various Mumblings.

Mixed and mastered by the Yellow Throated Marten.

## Bons Mots

2019-06-18

A year in the making, the piece started out as a series of modal drones merging into one another, transforming harmony and texture. Melodies and progression began to surface from the roiling fog, becoming tangible and giving the mists colour and flailing hands. Finally, a narrative shaped itself throughout the cloud's membrane.

The man and the eye. Which is observing whom?

Bob Murry Shelton - Guitar, Effects, Modular Synth, Modální Mlhy
Christian Michael Newman - Voice, Radioscapes, Soundscapes, Ctihodný Oko, Cover Concept and Art

Composition by Bob Murry Shelton
Words by Christian Michael Newman
Arranged, Mixed and Mastered by Flavigula
