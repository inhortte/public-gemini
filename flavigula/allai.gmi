"Allai" is the idea of looking yonder, up, over there, or on the bright side. It is the vast, yawning abstraction that engulfs you from any one of those places.

It's also the name of a plastic penguin that our imaginary flute player had as a child. That penguin meant everything. Please consider this whilst you listen.
