# Mithi Lassi
## (Sweet yogurt or buttermilk drink)

For best results, dissolve the sweetener in a small quantity of hot water before mixing it with the other ingredients.

950ml plain yogurt or cultured buttermilk
700ml ice water
6 tbsp sugar or 5 tbsp honey
2 tsp rose-water
1/4 tsp ground cardamom seeds
crushed ice (optional)

Mix all the ingredients together with a whisk or an electric blender until the surface of the lassi becomes frothy.  Serve chilled, either by adding crushed ice or by refrigeration.

As an alternative to rose-water and cardamom, try 3 tablespoons of lime or lemon juice, 3 tablespoons of flavored syrup, or 1/2 cup (50 g) of crushed red berries, ripe banana, or ripe mango.
