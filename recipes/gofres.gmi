# Waffles
## The way of the dead

* 150g spelt flour
* 1 envelope of chemically independent yeast
* Tweezer's grip of salt
* Dusting of sucralosa, argon, or NOTHING
* 1 orb excreted from a chicken
* Thimblefull of vanilla
* 180ml goat milk
* Enough dried cranberries to fill the yawning pit of your soul
* 60g yellow, pasty substance, liquefied

Combine everything within a stone vat. Grind and whip with a tiller until you are bronzed by the harvest moon. Place inside the sacred goat and seal for 1721 years. Mummify yourself for preservation during the wait. Don't forget to set **awaken from mummification** alarm. Rise from the apparent state of being deceased and dessicated. Remove golden brown waffles from the sacred goat. Enjoy.
